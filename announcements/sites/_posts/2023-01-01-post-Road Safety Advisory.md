Dear parents/guardians

We would like to seek your cooperation to work with the school to ensure the road safety for all our students. 

In particular, we seek your help by observing the following safety guidelines:
	
	1.	Exercise consideration for other road users and pedestrians by;
		a.	Cooperating with all traffic marshals to ensure overall safety and smooth traffic flow
		b.	Alight your child at designated drop-off points inside the school and avoid pick-ups/drop-offs along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 9 (AMK Ave 9)
		c.	Ensure that your child alights from the left side of the vehicle as safely and as quickly as possible
		d.	While queuing to enter the school compound, please keep to the left lane.  Avoid parking, waiting or leaving your vehicles along AMK Ave 9.
		e.	Observe vehicle speed limits:
				i.	Not more than 40 km/h along school zone (AMK Ave 9)
				ii.	Not more than 15 km/h within school premise
		f.	 Always keep a lookout for pedestrians.
		g.	Avoid driving recklessly and endangering other road users. Acts that are punishable by law include:
			i.	Abrupt left turns into the school from the outer lanes of the road
			ii.	Making illegal U-turn along AMK Ave 9
		h.	Time your arrivals to avoid forming traffic queues or waiting along AMK Ave 9. Take note that vehicles will only be allowed into the school compound about 20 minutes after the 1st dismissal. Currently, this is normally about 1.50pm on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and about 1.20pm on Thursdays and Fridays.
		
	2.	Educating our children on good road safety habits by;
		a.	Stressing the importance of using proper pedestrian crossings
		b.	Avoid using mobile devices while crossing the road
		c.	Practicing kerb drills before crossing the road - "look right, look left, look right again, ensure all vehicles have stopped, raise your hand high up and cross the road briskly"

	3.	For the safety of other road users, avoid waiting/parking;
		a.	Within yellow boxes (e.g. bus stop, outside school, Ang Mo Kio-Thye Hua Kwan Hospital {AMK-THK Hospital), or Nuovo condo)
		b.	Within 3m from a fire-hydrant
		c.	Within 6m from a junction/vehicular access of AMK-THK Hospital or Nuovo condo
		d.	Single white zig-zag line (zebra-controlled zone)
		e.	Along double yellow line to prevent congestion or obstruction to ambulance turning out from AMK-THK Hospital.
		f.	At road bends, entrances or exits of any access &
		g.	Parking abreast to another vehicle;

Under the current Road Traffic Act/Rules, any of the above acts constitute to a traffic offence. Upon receiving feedback of such occurrences, the authorities will take necessary action against the errant drivers. 

We would like to remind parents that any kind of waiting without immediate pick-up or drop-off activity, even with the driver in the vehicle or the engine and hazard lights on, is considered parking under the Road Traffic Act. As such, we strongly advise parents to arrive at school only when they are ready to perform the immediate pick-ups/drops offs. If there is a need to wait, we would advise you to park your vehicles at the nearby HDB car parks which gives a grace period to avoid getting unnecessary fines in future. 

We thank all parents and guardians for playing a part in keeping our roads safe for our children.
