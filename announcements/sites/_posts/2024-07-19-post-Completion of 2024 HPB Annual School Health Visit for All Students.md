<p>Dear Parent / Guardian,</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Health Promotion Board (HPB) has completed the annual school health
visit at our school.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may access your child’s School Health Assessment Summary Report on
HealthHub. You can view the video guide for more information.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Primary 5 students have been given a home vision screening chart for parent-administered
assessment of vision. This assessment is an estimation of your child/ward’s
visual acuity and is not a substitute for an eye examination by an optometrist
or ophthalmologist. Please seek advice from an optometrist or ophthalmologist
if required.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Director
<br>Youth Preventive Health Service
