<p>Dear Parents/Guardian,</p>
<p>2024 marks 40 years of Total Defence (TD40) in Singapore.</p>
<p>As part of our commemoration of TD40 this year, our students will experience
an energy disruption simulation in school on 16 February 2024. During which,
electricity will be turned off school-wide for an hour from 7.30 a.m. to
8.30 a.m..</p>
<p>This TD40 Exercise aims to prepare students for potential disruptions
to our energy supply (e.g., due to supply chain disruptions), given Singapore’s
reliance on fuel imports. In such a situation, electricity may have to
be prioritised for more critical areas, and households and organisations,
including schools, may have to endure disruptions in their electricity
supply. Following the exercise, students will reflect on the experience
and share their thoughts and feelings through a guided discussion by their
form teachers.</p>
<p>You may wish to engage your child/ward in sharing his/her experience with
you and reinforce the important notion that everyone has a part to play
in Singapore’s Total Defence effort.</p>
<p>Should your child/ward have any pre-existing conditions, please make the
necessary preparations to relieve any discomfort he/she may have during
this energy disruption exercise.</p>
<p>Should you require any clarifications, please contact us at 6456 0340
or email at <a href="mailto:lim_ser_yee@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">lim_ser_yee@moe.edu.sg</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for your invaluable support to imbue citizenship values in our
students through Total Defence.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>Mrs Fion Ho
<br>Head of Department
<br>Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
