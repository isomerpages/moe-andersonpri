Dear Parents/Guardians,

This is to notify you that photograph(s) and/or video recording(s) of our students and their parents/guardians may be captured during school activities and events such as classroom lessons, CCA sessions, school camps, school concerts and parent briefing sessions. The school may use and publish such photographs and video recordings in school publications, websites, social media platforms, Parents Gateway, and other communication channels. If you do not allow the school to use the photographs and/or video recordings,Â **please inform your child's/ward's Form Teacher by 13 Jan 2023 (Fri).**

Thank you.
