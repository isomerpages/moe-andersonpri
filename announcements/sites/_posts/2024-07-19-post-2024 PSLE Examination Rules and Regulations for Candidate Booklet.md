<p>Dear Parent/Guardian,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your child/ward has received the ‘2024 PSLE Examination Rules and Regulations
for Candidate Booklet’ today.</p>
<p>The booklet provides important instructions and regulations for PSLE.
Your child/ward is advised to read and comply with them.</p>
<p>The softcopy of the booklet is attached for your reference.</p>
<p>We would like to point your attention to the following instructions on <strong>pages 4 and 5</strong> of
the booklet.</p>
<p>• Candidates should write their answers clearly in blue / black ballpoint
pen. They are recommended to use a <strong>0.5mm tip ballpoint pen</strong>.
This is to reduce possible smudging and to ensure clarity of writing. If
they need to change their answers, they should cross them out and re-write
the answers.</p>
<p>• Candidates <strong>should not write their answers in pencil</strong> as
the responses may appear too faint for marking.</p>
<p>• Candidates <strong>should not use the correction fluid / tape in the examinations</strong> as
it may affect the legibility of answers. There are instances where candidates
did not complete their answers after the correction fluid / tape had been
applied. Correction fluid / tape may also damage the answer scripts.</p>
<p>• Candidates should also avoid using the highlighter to highlight any
part of the answers as this may affect legibility of the answers. It is
also not advisable to use erasable ink pen.</p>
<p>These important instructions <strong>have been highlighted to the students</strong> and
they should comply with the regulations for all examinations. We seek your
support in reiterating the instructions to your child/ward.</p>
<p>If you have any queries, please contact your child’s/ward’s Form Teacher
for clarification.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support as our partners-in-education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,
<br>Mrs Vimala Ratnaraja
<br>Year Head (Upper Primary)</p>
