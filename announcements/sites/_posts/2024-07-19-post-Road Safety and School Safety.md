<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Today, during our morning assembly, we shared important road safety and
school safety guidelines with our students. They are reminded of the essential
Do’s and Don’ts when crossing the road, such as raising their hands when
crossing, avoiding running across roads, and staying alert by not using
their handphones while crossing. Additionally, we emphasised the importance
of safety within the school premises, including not playing on staircases,
refraining from running along the corridors and the canteen, and only boarding
and alighting at the designated drop-off area.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We kindly request your support in reinforcing these safety measures with
your children at home. Please take a moment to discuss the importance of
these guidelines to ensure their continued safety. Attached is a joint
advisory with LTA and SPF on Traffic Management and Road Safety for your
reference. Thank you for your cooperation in keeping our school community
safe.</p>
