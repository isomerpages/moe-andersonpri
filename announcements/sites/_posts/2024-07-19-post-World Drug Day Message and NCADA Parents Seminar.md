<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p><strong>World Drug Day Message and NCADA Parents Seminar</strong>
</p>
<p>Every year on 26 June, the world commemorates the International Day against
Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking (also known as World Drug Day).</p>
<p>Please find attached the message from the Chairman of the National Council
Against Drug Abuse (NCADA). This message aims to engage and inform parents
about the importance of our collective efforts in combating drug abuse.</p>
<p>NCADA will be conducting a Parents Seminar on 3 August 2024, featuring
a panel of experts who will share valuable insights on dealing with the
increasing permissiveness towards drug abuse.</p>
<p>We would like to encourage all of you to look out for details of this
event via the NCADA website (<a href="http://ncada.org.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">http://ncada.org.sg/</a>) or NCADA Facebook
(<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ncadasg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/ncadasg</a>).</p>
<p>Your support and collaboration in this initiative are greatly appreciated,
and we look forward to working together to create a safer and healthier
environment for our children.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Sent on behalf of the
<br>National Council Against Drug Abuse</p>
