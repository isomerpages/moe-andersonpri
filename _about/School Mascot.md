<p>Shortly after the launch of the Anderson Heritage Gallery in February
2021, a sunbird’s nest was discovered among the potted plants at the gallery
entrance. When a chick fell after its first flight, the school community
came together to care for it. The Principal then, Mdm Delia Hoo, highlighted
the sunbird’s agility, beauty, intelligence, and adaptability – qualities
aligned with Anderson’s LIGHT Values. Inspired by this story, students
interpreted the sunbird through art, naming it and designing prototypes
for its ideal home.</p>
<p>Since 2021, the olive-backed sunbird has been our school mascot, with
the final design created by Art teacher, Mrs. Aretha Ng, based on students’
sketches from the Sunbird Challenge led by our prefects.</p>
