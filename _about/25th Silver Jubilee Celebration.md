<p><strong>Celebrating 25 Years of Excellence: Anderson Primary’s Silver Jubilee&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>2025 is a landmark year for Anderson Primary School as we proudly celebrate
our 25<sup>th</sup> School Anniversary. Established in 2000 through the
merger of Ang Mo Kio North Primary, Hong Dao Primary, and Li Hua Primary,
our school has since grown into a pillar of excellence in Ang Mo Kio. Anchored
in our values-driven education, innovative teaching practices, and strong
community partnerships, Anderson Primary continues to shape generations
of learners and leaders.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Mirrors of Light—Reflecting Our Past, Illuminating the Future</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Silver Jubilee is more than just a celebration; it is a tribute to
the dedication of our teachers, the achievements of our students, and the
unwavering support of our families and community. Inspired by the theme
Mirrors of Light, we honour the brilliance of our shared journey—capturing
the legacy of our past while illuminating the path ahead. Just as mirrors
reflect and amplify light, we strive to inspire a future filled with passion,
purpose, and limitless possibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join us as we embark on this exciting journey of honouring our past, celebrating
our present, and inspiring the future. Stay tuned for updates on our Silver
Jubilee celebrations—together, as One Anderson, we will continue to shine
brightly for generations to come.&nbsp;
