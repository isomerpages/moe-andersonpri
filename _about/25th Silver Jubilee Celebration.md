<h3><strong>Anderson Primary Schoolâ€™s Silver Jubilee Celebration</strong></h3>
<p>2025 is a special year for Anderson Primary School.</p>
<p>As we start this year, we remember that it is our 25th School Anniversary.
Our school was established in the year 2000 from a merger of three schools
in this precinct: And Mo Kio North Primary, Hong Dao Primary and Li Hua
Primary. Since its inception, Anderson Primary School has flourished into
a leading institution in Ang Mo Kio, known for its values-driven education,
innovative teaching and learning practices, and strong community partnerships.
From past to present and even looking ahead to the future, our school remains
relentless in our pursuit to nurture learners with passion, leaders with
heart, and citizens of character who embody the school values of LIGHT <em>(Learning unceasingly, Innovation, Gratitude, Hand-in-hand, Trustworthiness)</em>.</p>
<p>Our Silver Jubilee celebrations mark a momentous milestone in our journey
of shaping Pioneers of The Future. Guided by the theme 'Mirrors of Light,'
this celebration reflects the brilliance of our past and present, honouring
the unwavering dedication of our teachers, the achievements of our students,
and the breakthroughs made possible by the strong partnerships with families
and the community. Like mirrors that capture and magnify light, our Silver
Jubilee invites us to illuminate our rich legacy as we collectively inspire
a future filled with passion, purpose, and endless possibilities. As one
Anderson, we will remain steadfast to our mission: nurture young minds,
ignite curiosity, and empower our students as visionaries, lifelong learners
and leaders with heart ready and poised for the future.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates as we embark on this exciting journey of honoring
our past, celebrating our present, and inspiring the future.</p>
