<p>Our Silver Jubilee was more than just a celebration; it was a tribute
to the dedication of our teachers, the achievements of our students, and
the unwavering support of our families and community. Inspired by the theme
Mirrors of Light, we honoured the brilliance of our shared journey, capturing
the legacy of our past while illuminating the path ahead. Just as mirrors
reflect and amplify light, we strive to inspire a future filled with passion,
purpose, and limitless possibilities.</p>
<p>The Silver Jubilee event was held at the Victoria Theatre on 19 November
2025, graced by our Guest of Honour, Mdm Delia Hoo. Invited guests included
past principals, staff, and esteemed members of the Anderson family. Together,
we celebrated this landmark year with pride and joy, recognising the collective
contributions that have shaped Anderson Primary into the thriving community
it is today.</p>
<p>As we reflect on this milestone, we remain inspired to continue our journey—honouring
our past, celebrating our present, and shaping a future of excellence.
Together, as One Anderson, we will continue to shine brightly for generations
to come.</p>
