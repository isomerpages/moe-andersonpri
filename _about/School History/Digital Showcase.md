#### ANDERSON 20TH ANNIVERSARY ART EXHIBITION AND DIGITAL SHOWCASE
#### 
We proudly celebrate the 20th anniversary of Anderson Primary School. It is a milestone marking two decades of commitment to nurturing Andersonians as all-round learners with passion, leaders with heart, and citizens of character. With a firm belief to cultivate character qualities and many notable achievements in the arts past and present, indeed, what better way to commemorate the special occasion than with a showcase of the vibrant arts culture in Anderson.

For the first time, we venture into the digital space to present this art exhibition. Aptly themed **‘With Gratitude & Fortitude, We Make It Happen!’**, it features curated artworks of students and teachers in various mediums. The collection of artworks presents the multifaceted and holistic art making experiences in shaping the artistry of our student artists. While there were many challenges we had to overcome this year, the joy of and commitment to artmaking remain blazingly strong.

Enjoy this labor of love put together by the teachers and students of Anderson Primary.
