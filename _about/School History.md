<h4><strong>A Legacy Of Excellence: The Journey Of Anderson Primary School</strong></h4>
<p>Anderson Primary School was born in 2000, emerging from the merger of
three schools—Ang Mo Kio North Primary, Hong Dao Primary, and Li Hua Primary.
From its very first days, the school set out to build a culture of excellence,
anchored in strong values, quality teaching, and a nurturing environment
for every learner. Under the guidance of its first Principal, Mr Lawrence
Chong, Anderson Primary quickly became a preferred choice in Ang Mo Kio.
Its reputation for academic rigor, vibrant co-curricular programmes, and
meaningful partnerships with parents and the wider community laid the foundation
for a thriving and dynamic school.</p>
<p>Over the years, Anderson Primary’s journey has been shaped by dedicated
leaders who have strengthened its identity and enriched its culture. Mr
Martin Tan led the school from 2007 to 2011, followed by Mrs Tan Wie Pin
from 2012 to 2018, and Mdm Delia Hoo from 2019 to 2024. Each brought their
own vision, passion, and commitment, ensuring that the school’s values
and standards continued to flourish.</p>
<p>Today, Anderson Primary is proudly led by Ms Shirley Leow, Principal,
supported by Mr Thomas Boh, Vice-Principal (Academic), Ms Jolyn Chua, Vice-Principal
(Academic) and Ms Rae Tan, Vice-Principal (Administrative). The current
leadership team remains steadfast in their mission to build on this strong
foundation, guiding the school with purpose and ambition. Together, they
continue to inspire generations of learners, uphold a culture of excellence,
and lead Anderson Primary to new heights.</p>
