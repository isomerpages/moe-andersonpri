<p><strong>Welcome Back to School in 2025!</strong>
</p>
<p>As we usher in the new academic year, I am honored to join Anderson Primary
School as your Principal. This marks an exciting new chapter for all of
us as we continue to grow and excel together.</p>
<p>Anderson Primary School is a place where we aspire to be “Pioneers of
the Future” and uphold the values encapsulated in our guiding philosophy,
the “School of LIGHT”:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Learn Unceasingly</strong>,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Gratitude</strong>,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Innovation</strong>,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Hand in Hand</strong>,
and</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Trustworthiness</strong>.</p>
<p>I believe in the principle of “<strong>先做人再做事</strong>” (“First develop
good character, then achieve great deeds”). Character development is central
to our mission, as it sustains passion, purpose, and integrity. These values
will continue to shape our commitment to nurturing passionate learners,
leaders with heart, and citizens of character. In today’s evolving world,
it is also essential that our students are equipped with the skills and
dispositions to lead meaningful lives in a globally connected society.
Alongside a strong foundation in literacy and numeracy, we will emphasize
21st-century competencies and educational technology to prepare them for
future challenges.</p>
<p>It is my privilege to lead Anderson Primary School, building on the admirable
work of my predecessors, especially Mdm Delia Hoo. I am deeply committed
to continuing our school’s ascent towards excellence and fostering an environment
where every child can thrive. Education is a shared responsibility, and
I look forward to partnering with every member of our school community
— our dedicated staff, supportive parents, and inspiring students — to
achieve our collective goals. Together, let us walk hand in hand towards
a bright and promising future for our children.</p>
<p>Here’s to a fantastic 2025! Let us shine our LIGHT brightly and pioneer
the future with confidence and hope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><strong>Principal</strong>
