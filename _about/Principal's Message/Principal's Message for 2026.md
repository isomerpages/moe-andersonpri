<p><strong>Welcoming 2026 With Gratitude and Hope</strong>
</p>
<p>As we welcome 2026, our hearts are full. Last year’s Jubilee celebration
reminded us of how far we have come together - students, staff, parents,
and partners who have each played a meaningful role in our story. With
that cherished chapter now gently closed, we step into a new year with
renewed hope, deeper appreciation, and a strong sense of unity. As the
saying goes, “饮水思源” (when drinking water, remember its source), a spirit
of gratitude we carry forward as we begin this new chapter.</p>
<p>In the year ahead, we remain anchored in what matters most: nurturing
every child who walks through our gates. We will continue to strengthen
Learning and Teaching to spark curiosity, build confidence, and cultivate
the joy of discovery. This includes thoughtfully integrating AI tools in
our learning processes, always guided by our values. When used purposefully
and responsibly, technology opens doors to richer learning experiences
and helps our children become discerning, ethical users of digital tools.</p>
<p>We are also excited to develop the Anderson Academy, designed specially
for our high-ability students to deepen their learning, explore their passions,
and grow in their strengths. We hold close the belief expressed in “厚积薄发”
(with solid preparation comes the ability to shine), and we hope every
child will flourish in their own time and in their own way.</p>
<p>At the heart of our work is Character Development. Our refreshed LIGHT
Values - Lifelong Learning, Integrity, Gratitude, Harmony, and Tenacity
- together with our school motto, Courage and Sincerity, remind us of who
we are and what we aspire to be. These values guide our decisions, shape
our programmes, and anchor our hopes for every child, echoing the spirit
of “德才并重” (virtue and ability in equal measure).</p>
<p>As we journey into 2026, we do so with warmth, gratitude, and optimism.
We are deeply thankful for the trust placed in us and honoured to partner
our families and community. Together, we will continue to nurture children
of character, compassion, and resilience—living out the belief that “携手同行，必能行稳致远”
(when we walk forward hand in hand, we can go far and go well).</p>
<p>With gratitude and sincerity,
<br><strong>Shirley Leow (Ms)</strong>
<br><strong>Principal</strong>
