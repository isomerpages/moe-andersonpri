<p><u><em>Our POTF Journey Thus Far<br></em></u>

2023 is the third year of Pioneers of the Future (POTF) implementation, a running theme since 2021, in the midst of Covid-19. It was meant to be a swift response to the unprecedented nature and extent of change happening around us. As educators, we recognised the accelerating pace of transformation in our operating environment, and how it was incumbent on us to make the necessary shifts fast. We have envisioned our Andersonians to be ever-more future-ready. We want to empower them with essential skills and learning dispositions to thrive in this&nbsp;_VUCA_&nbsp;world. We desire to nurture our students to love learning, think out-of-the-box, remain indomitable in the face of setbacks, and always ready to learn from and serve others. In short, we envision our Andersonians to have a pioneering mindset as they grow up in a generation where opportunities are boundless and borderless.

<u><em>How we operationalize POTF  <br></em></u>

To operationalise POTF, we take reference from our School Vision. We focus on each tenet&nbsp;_Learners with Passion, Leaders with Heart, Citizens of Character_&nbsp;– one year at a time. This has, so far, given us a helpful and practical lens to plan and scope our school programmes. We flesh out the school theme further by adopting a more child-accessible, child-friendly language. In 2021, our school theme was POTF:&nbsp;_Reimagining Learning_, with the tagline of ‘Seeing New Possibilities’, thanks to a plethora of e-Pedagogy tools, virtual learning and engagement platforms as well as new and exciting partnerships forged to promote rich learning. In 2022, it was POTF:&nbsp;_Redefining Leadership_, accompanied by the tagline ‘It Starts With Me’. This aligned well with our educator’s beliefs: that the learner’s sense of ownership is of paramount importance in sustaining passionate, lifelong learning. They lead themselves, first. They initiate and create the positive change they wish to see. In other words, they learn to take charge – it starts with them individually.

&nbsp;<u><em>2023 POTF:&nbsp;_Reframing Citizenship_<br></em></u>

2023 School Theme continues to mirror our School Vision – the third tenet on Citizenship. There is so much to unpack for ‘Citizenship’. It is also timely as we deepen CCE 2021 Syllabus enactment in the classroom. At the same time, we want foreground citizenship literacies, values and dispositions from other frames of perspective, including digital citizenship and global citizenship. The mega-theme continues to be ‘Sustainability’, riding on our curricular strengths identified by our Customised Validation Team in 2022 as we take further strides towards the aspirational goal of a ‘Zero Waste School’. More importantly, we want to impress on our Andersonians that being a good citizen is about developing and strengthening one’s character. In the year ahead, as a school community, we will be ever more intentional in providing our Andersonians authentic platforms to internalise and demonstrate good habits and values and shine the Anderson LIGHT. It is my vision that Andersonians, through this process, may experience the joy of helping, serving and caring for others, and learn to ‘Put Others First’. I look forward to celebrating their personal growth and the contributions they will make to the community.
