<p>Our vision is to be the choice partner school for stakeholders in education. Our mission guided by our values is to partner with stakeholders to realise the school's vision and mission through collaboration, engagement and implementation.</p>
<p>With&nbsp;<em>LIGHT</em>&nbsp;as its core, to drive a Growing Organisation and Staff Capacity and using&nbsp;<em>COMPASS</em>&nbsp;to guide in our pursuit of student all-round excellence, the school strengthens its strategic partnerships through the identification of&nbsp;<em>LENS</em>.</p>
<p>Strengthening our strategic partnership helps the school to leverage the expert knowledge of industry players and the community at large and to synergize with our partners to broaden the school's knowledge base, and to contribute back to the society that we are a part of.</p>
