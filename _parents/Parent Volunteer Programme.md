<p><strong>Parent Volunteer Scheme</strong></p>
<p>The Parent Volunteer (PV) Scheme is open to&nbsp;parents of children who are Singapore Citizens/Singapore Permanent Residents&nbsp;due for the P1 Registration Exercise.&nbsp;The school selects PV applicants who are generally able to contribute in areas which are aligned to the school&rsquo;s direction, programmes and desired outcomes for both staff and students.</p>
<p>Registration for our PV Scheme (for 2024 P1 Intake in Phase 2B) will commence on Feb 2022 and will close on 29 Apr 2022. Our school will shortlist 20 PVs and only shortlisted PV applicant will be informed by 10 Jun 2022. </p>
<p>PVs&nbsp;<u>must</u>&nbsp;fulfill at least 40 hours of acceptable PV service by 31 May 2023, which is before the commencement of 2024 P1 Registration Exercise. We seek all successful applicants&rsquo; understanding that being on the PV scheme&nbsp;<u>does not</u>&nbsp;guarantee your child a place in the school for 2024 P1 Admission.</p>

<p>Parents should refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration/registration-phases-key-dates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registration phases and procedures&nbsp;</a>to find out which phase their children are eligible for, how to register and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration/how-to-register" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documents required&nbsp;</a>for registration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Primary One Internet System for Registration&nbsp;</p>

<p>MOE has introduced the Primary One Internet System (P1-IS) to all primary schools since 2014. The P1-IS serves as an alternate channel to facilitate the registration of children during Phase 2C and Phase 2C Supplementary. To register online via the P1-IS, both Parents&rsquo; SingPass are required. From 5 July 2016 onwards, all e-government transactions will require 2-Step Verification, otherwise known as Two Factor Authentication (2FA). For more information, please click&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ifaq.gov.sg/SINGPASS/apps/fcd_faqmain.aspx?TOPIC=9374#TOPIC_9374" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&nbsp;</a>. Parents who register online will have to produce the originals of each required document to the school the child is successfully registered when requested by the school or upon reporting to the school. Parents who do not wish to use the P1-IS to register their child can continue to do so by going to their school of choice for registration.</p>
