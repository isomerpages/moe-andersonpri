	<p>Primary One Internet System for Registration&nbsp;</p>
	
	<p>MOE has introduced the Primary One Internet System (P1-IS) to all primary schools since 2014. The P1-IS serves as an alternate channel to facilitate the registration of children during Phase 2C and Phase 2C Supplementary. To register online via the P1-IS, both Parents&rsquo; SingPass are required. From 5 July 2016 onwards, all e-government transactions will require 2-Step Verification, otherwise known as Two Factor Authentication (2FA). For more information, please click&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ifaq.gov.sg/SINGPASS/apps/fcd_faqmain.aspx?TOPIC=9374#TOPIC_9374" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&nbsp;</a>. Parents who register online will have to produce the originals of each required document to the school the child is successfully registered when requested by the school or upon reporting to the school. Parents who do not wish to use the P1-IS to register their child can continue to do so by going to their school of choice for registration.</p>
