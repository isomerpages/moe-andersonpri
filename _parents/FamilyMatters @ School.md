<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Empowering families through FamilyMatters@School! Because FAMILY matters.</p>
<p>Our family is the anchor in our lives, bringing us love, joy and warmth. Our family supports us, keeps us rooted and gives meaning to our existence. A happy family does not just happen. It takes effort and commitment.</p>
<p>FamilyMatters@School is an initiative by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF). Anderson Primary School has embarked on FamilyMatters@School to empower parents with the resources, knowledge and skills to build a strong and happy family. Parents will be equipped with effective parenting skills to nurture positive family relationships and help them better connect with their children and spouses. In addition, we also provide pupils with life-skills training.</p>

<ul>
