<p>LTA has completed a sheltered linkway along the footpath outside the school from the main vehicular entrance (Gate B) to the junction of Ang Mo Kio (AMK) Ave 6 and 9. They have also extended the shelter to the school&rsquo;s Gate E.&nbsp;Please see the following photographs.</p>

<p>Together with the existing linkway from the Ang Mo Kio – Thye Hua Kwan (AMK-THK) Hospital exit to the school’s Gate A, all pedestrians will have a sheltered walk from school to the 2 signalised pedestrian traffic crossing and traffic junction.  This will help to keep our parents sheltered from the sun and rain while they wait for our pupils during dismissal. </p>
