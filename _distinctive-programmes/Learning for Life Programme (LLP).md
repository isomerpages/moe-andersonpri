Every child has a voice, and&nbsp;<strong>ANDventure</strong>&nbsp;provides the opportunities for these voices to be heard and ideas to be realised. For lower primary students who demonstrate aptitude and interest in performing arts, our Performing Arts Early Specialisation Programme allows them to begin their exploration at P2 before transiting into the more rigorous Performing Arts CCA programme from P3 to P6.</p>
