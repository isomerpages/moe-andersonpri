<p><strong><em>ANDventure Drama Education</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;Care for something bigger than me&rdquo; - Strengthening 21CC and Character through Process Drama</em></strong></p>
<p>Students will learn about the creative and symbolic use of the elements of drama - plot, time, space, roles &amp; relationship through their exploration of climate change using process drama conventions like Freeze Frames, Conscience Alley and Thought-tracking. With their collective inputs, they will devise their own drama using a scene-based approach to advocate environment care. Using our specially selected Digital Engagement platforms, students will be able to document their creative energies, performance skills in a collaborative manner. Besides developing negotiation skills with others in a group as they adapt and accommodate to different ideas, they also build their confidence in public speaking in a safe environment. The multi-faceted learning experiences will culminate into a student-led conference.&nbsp;</p>
