<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>As pioneers of the future, learning will be re-imagined at Anderson Primary through&nbsp;<strong><em>Eureka!</em></strong>, our STEM Applied Learning Programme (ALP).&nbsp;<strong><em>Eureka!&nbsp;</em></strong>focuses on igniting students’ natural curiosity and developing learners with a dare-to-try spirit and the passion to explore the various disciplines of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Through purposeful multi-disciplinary learning experiences, Andersonians will see the usefulness of their learning in the real world and become active, creative and caring environmentalists and agents who are knowledgeable in the use of materials and matter. Deep learning will be promoted by connecting classroom learning with real-life applications and providing opportunities for Andersonians to creatively apply concepts to solve authentic problems.</p>
<p><strong><em>Eureka!&nbsp;</em></strong>comprises various STEM modules delivered through the curriculum, after-school enrichment, CCA and external programmes and competitions. These STEM modules focus on experiential learning, self-discovery through doing, and cultivation of thinking dispositions of a Mathematician, Scientist and Engineer. The Engineering Design Process will be used to scaffold students’ thinking, facilitate the processes of problem solving and provide the structure for product design. We hope that these varied learning experiences will inspire Andersonians, as Pioneers of the Future, to contribute towards STEM research, innovation and enterprise and pursue STEM-related careers to serve the good of society.</p>
<h4><strong>Multi-Disciplinary Eureka! Modules</strong></h4>
<p><strong>(i)	P1 Eureka! with the Catapult</strong></p>
<p>How can you knock down castle walls without being anywhere near them? Students explored why catapults were invented and how they work before making their very own catapult using recycled materials such as a bottle cap, ice cream sticks, tape and rubber bands. With a successful launch of an object from their self-constructed catapult, students earn their very own Eureka! badge.</p>

<p><strong>(ii)	P2 Eureka! goes outdoor with PAL – Transforming Food Waste into Sustainable Soil Materials</strong></p>
<p>Core ideas and practices of science are integrated into the lower primary PAL – Outdoor Education module to complement and broaden Andersonians’ perspectives as they explore the diversity of plants around them. As budding Young Botanists, students identified leaves of different shapes and sizes and used their creativity to make various leaf art pieces.</p>

<p>Through this programme, the environmental message of giving plastic waste a second lease of life was instilled amongst the students where they learnt to see plastic waste and their properties in a different&nbsp;light.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Integrated STEM with Computational Thinking, Textiles and Sewing (iSTEM-CT2S) Module</strong></h4>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>iSTEM-CT<sup>2</sup>S</em>&nbsp;pilot module is a human-centric STEM Curriculum designed by STEM@ NIE Singapore in collaboration with The University of Vaud Canton of Education, Switzerland, and supported by BERNINA (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this module, selected Primary 5 students&nbsp;experienced inter-disciplinary learning through the applications of concepts from different subject disciplines such as Textile Science and TurtleStitch Coding skills to solve real-world problems. Students acquired computational thinking skills and understood how technology could be harnessed to improve the lives of humans.</p>
<p>Through this module, students had the rare opportunity to programme a sewing machine to stitch their coded pattern and sewed their own face mask using a high-technology Swiss-engineered BERNINA sewing machine.</p>
