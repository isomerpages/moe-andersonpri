<p>The school views education as one that engages every learner to be a key response to the changes and opportunities brought by globalization and the 21st Century. We recognize education as a vital social leveller and are committed to creating opportunities for pupils from different socio-economic backgrounds to learn and succeed. We believe that every pupil has the capacity to learn and succeed. We subscribe to the notion of whole child development and therefore ensure the provision of all-round development through a myriad of co-curricular programmes to augment the formal curriculum.</p>
