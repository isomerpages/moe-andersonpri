<div>Anderson Primary School has come a long way since its beginnings in the year 2000 from a merger of three schools: Ang Mo Kio North Primary, Hong Dao Primary and Li Hua Primary. Almost two decades on, it secures a position of strength. Today, it is a school of choice &ndash; a testament of good leadership, unity of purpose and labour of love.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Anderson Primary School believes in the experiential, constructivist approach to learning. This firm belief is effectively translated into a rich array of authentic learning opportunities beyond the classroom, each seeking to strengthen students&rsquo; intrinsic motivation to learn and self-efficacy to keep learning. The school also offers two distinctive programmes or Learning for Life Programmes (LLP). These are our signature programmes. They are in the domains of Music and Performing Arts and Sports &amp; Outdoor Education.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In 2018, under Mrs Tan Wie Pin&rsquo;s leadership, the school was duly recognised for its student-centric focus and holistic school programmes. In the Singapore Youth Festival 2018, Anderson Primary School&rsquo;s Performing Arts CCA attained one Accomplishment Award for Angklung Ensemble and five Distinction Awards: for Brass Band, Chinese Dance, Guitar Ensemble, Guzheng Ensemble and International Dance. At the end of the school year, Anderson Primary School staged its second public concert People, Passion, Poise II &ndash; Wings of Wonder at the Victoria Theatre on 14 November 2018. In Sports, our Basketball and Volleyball school teams emerged among the Top 4 in the North Zone Championships, Top 16 in the Nationals. The school has a close partnership with BCA, Keppel &amp; Terra SG. It set up a Sustainable Gallery on school grounds to promote environmental awareness as well as strengthen student advocacy in environment stewardship and care. For our pro-environment initiatives and efforts in implementing a holistic environment education, Anderson Primary School was awarded the Vanda Miss Joaquim Award in the Singapore Environment Council-StarHub School Green Awards in October 2018.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is my privilege to be given this mandate and duty to lead Anderson Primary School in its continuous growth and ascent towards excellence while building upon the admirable work by Mrs Tan Wie Pin (third Principal), and that of Mr Martin Tan (second Principal) and Mr Lawrence Chong (first Principal).&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the year ahead, Anderson Primary School remains committed to amplifying opportunities that engender passion for learning. Similarly, it remains dedicated to strengthening student well-being as well as deepening our beliefs and dispositions as a community of learners.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let&rsquo;s welcome another year of discovery, deep learning and transformational growth.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Happy New Year to all.</div>
