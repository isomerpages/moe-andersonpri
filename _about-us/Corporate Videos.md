<p class=""><span class="">Anderson Primary School values the holistic development of every child and seeks every opportunity to maximise the potential of all our students, both in academic and non-academic domains.</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">Following the completion of PRIME in 2016, a wide range of new and enhanced facilities create an even vibrant environment for greater engaged learning to take place. The school&rsquo;s Learning for Life Programmes in Arts and Sports are also able to tap into the availability of open and creative spaces to inspire exploration and self-directed learning.</span></p>
<p class=""><span class="">Catch our young Andersonians in action, and feel their energy as they go all out to be Learners with Passion, Leaders with Heart, Citizens of Character.</span></p>
