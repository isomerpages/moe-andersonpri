<p>At Anderson Primary School, we bequeath our students with a Compass and a Torch, each symbolising the necessary values and skills to lead and light the way as they forge ahead in the 21st century.</p>
<h4><strong>The Anderson COMPASS</strong></h4>

<p>The Anderson COMPASS is a representation of the school's Total Curriculum. It is our Teaching &amp; Learning Framework that holds together and encompasses 7 domains of student holistic learning and development. It is a symbol of what the Anderson programme stands for and what the school endeavours to provide for every student.</p>

<p>Symbolising an unceasing source of illumination, courage and sincerity, is a flame on a torch. It represents the Anderson LIGHT, which expresses our commitment to nurture in our students a positive core made up of strong values. With an unwavering positive core, our students can illuminate and courageously forge their way forward, especially in an increasingly complex and uncertain world.</p>
