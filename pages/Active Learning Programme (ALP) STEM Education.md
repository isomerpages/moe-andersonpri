### Overview

As Pioneers of the Future, learning is re-imagined at Anderson Primary School through **_Eureka_**, our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in STEM Education (Material Science).

**_Eureka_** focuses on igniting students’ natural curiosity and developing learners with a dare-to-try spirit and the passion to explore the various disciplines of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). 

Through purposeful **multi-disciplinary learning experiences**, Andersonians will be able to apply their learning to the real world contexts to become active, creative and caring environmentalists and change agents who are knowledgeable in the use of materials and matter. Deep learning will be promoted by connecting classroom learning with real-life applications and providing opportunities for Andersonians to creatively apply concepts to solve authentic problems.

**_Eureka_** comprises **STEM modules** delivered through the curriculum, after-school enrichment and CCA. These STEM modules focus on experiential learning, self-discovery through doing, and cultivation of thinking dispositions of a Mathematician, Scientist and Engineer. The Engineering Design Process will be used to scaffold students’ thinking, facilitate the processes of problem solving and provide the structure for product design. We hope that these varied learning experiences will inspire Andersonians, as Pioneers of the Future, to contribute towards STEM research, innovation and enterprise and pursue STEM-related careers to serve the good of society.

#### Disciplinary Learning Experiences  

**(i) Eureka goes outdoor with PAL - Transforming Food Waste into Sustainable Soil
**

Core ideas and practices of Science are integrated into the lower primary PAL - Outdoor Education module to complement and broaden Andersonians' perspectives as they explore the diversity of plants around them. As budding Young Botanists, students identified leaves of different shapes and sizes and used their creativity to make various leaf art pieces.

Primary 2 students also attended an online enrichment workshop to learn how to recycle organic food waste into Vermicast (an organic fertiliser) using worms. Students then harvested Vermicast from our worms bins and created a potting mix using sustainable materials for growing various seeds at home.

We believe that every Andersonian can become responsible and reflective citizens, and Environment Stewards of Sustainability. Together, we can build a resilient future in food security by growing crops at home using sustainable soil materials. 

**ii) The Anderson STEM Box**

The  *Anderson STEM Box* is gifted to each Primary 3 student to inspire them to have the sense of adventure that a Scientist seeks, and the adventure of the mind to experiment, tinker and discover about the everyday phenomena happening around them. Found within the box are activity kits such as the DIY STEM Bristlebot and Magnetism Kit; and resource cards such as the Flexagon, to connect, complement and extend what they will be learning in Primary 3 Science.
