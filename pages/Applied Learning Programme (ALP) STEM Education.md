<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>As Pioneers of the Future, learning is re-imagined at Anderson Primary
School through&nbsp;<strong><em>Eureka!</em></strong>, our Applied Learning
Programme (ALP) in STEM Education (Material Science).</p>
<p><strong><em>Eureka!</em></strong>&nbsp;focuses on igniting students’ natural
curiosity and developing learners with a dare-to-try spirit and the passion
to explore the various disciplines of Science, Technology, Engineering
and Mathematics (STEM).</p>
<p>Through purposeful&nbsp;<strong>multi-disciplinary learning experiences</strong>,
Andersonians will apply their learning to real-world contexts to become
active, creative and caring environmentalists and change agents, knowledgeable
in the use of materials and matter. Deep learning will be promoted by connecting
classroom learning with real-life applications and providing opportunities
for Andersonians to apply concepts to solve authentic problems.</p>
<p><strong><em>Eureka!</em></strong>&nbsp;comprises&nbsp;<strong>STEM modules</strong>&nbsp;delivered
through the curriculum, after-school enrichment and CCA. These STEM modules
focus on experiential learning, self-discovery through doing, and the cultivation
of the thinking dispositions of a Mathematician, Scientist and Engineer.
The Engineering Design Process is used to scaffold students’ thinking,
facilitate problem-solving and provide the structure for product design.
We hope that these varied learning experiences will inspire Andersonians,
as Pioneers of the Future, to contribute towards STEM research, innovation
and enterprise and pursue STEM-related careers to serve the good of society.</p>

<p><strong>Multi-Disciplinary&nbsp;<em>Eureka!</em>&nbsp;Modules</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>P1 Eureka!</em>&nbsp;with the Catapult</strong>
<br>How can you knock down castle walls without being anywhere near them?
Students explored the history of catapults and how they work before making
theirs using recycled materials such as a bottle cap, ice cream sticks,
tape and rubber bands. After launching an object from their self-constructed
catapult, students earn their very own&nbsp;<em>Eureka!</em>&nbsp;badge.</p>

<p><strong><em>P2 Eureka!</em>&nbsp;goes outdoor with PAL – Transforming Food Waste into Sustainable Soil Materials</strong>
<br>Core ideas and practices of science are infused with the lower primary
PAL – Outdoor Education module to complement and broaden Andersonians’
perspectives as they explore the diversity of plants around them. As budding
Young Botanists, students identified leaves of different shapes and sizes
and used their creativity to make various leaf art pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Students also attended a Microgreen enrichment workshop to use sustainable
fertilisers such as Cocopeat and Vermicast to grow microgreens in a fabric
planter. Students learnt about the phases of a Microgreen Life Cycle and
compared the properties of different materials (e.g. fabric, bamboo, cork)
used to make fabric planters.</p>

</div>
<p>Taking on the role of a Zero Waste Ambassador, students created a stationery
prototype using recycled materials. The Engineering Design Process was
used to facilitate this prototyping phase. Students applied what they learned
about Materials and made pieces of stationery using paper and plastic.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>P4 Eureka!</em>&nbsp;in Zero Waste Management – Textile Upcycling &amp; Material Repurposing</strong>
<br>Students continued their Zero Waste journey by managing paper and plastic
waste and learning about the properties of different fabric types. They
learnt how old clothes could be given a new lease of life. Old clothes
were upcycled into products which served another purpose. Students made
beautiful pencil cases, tote bags, bookmarks, coasters and tissue packet
holders from used clothes. It was an enriching and enlightening experience
to learn about a Fashion Circular Economy within the school.</p>

<p><strong><em>P5 Eureka!</em>&nbsp;in Food Waste Management – Technologies in Urban Farming</strong>
<br>Following their experience from the Primary 2 Microgreen Cultivation,
Primary 5 students deepened their learning by being an urban farmer who
grows food using a high-technology farming system. Students grew crops
in a vertical farming tower and journeyed as young engineers to explore
the use of micro:bits in the automation of processes in a mini-farm prototype.
Indeed, there were many&nbsp;<em>Eureka!</em>&nbsp;moments for students
in this journey towards fostering food resilience.</p>

<p>We believe that every Andersonian can become responsible and reflective
citizens, and Environment Stewards of Sustainability. Together, we can
build a resilient future in food security by growing crops sustainable
soil materials and high-tech farming systems.</p>

<p><strong><em>P6 Eureka!</em>&nbsp;in Green Energy Sources – Designing Biophilic-Eco Buildings</strong>
<br>As a finale to the series of&nbsp;<em>Eureka!&nbsp;</em>STEM modules,
Primary 6 students were tasked to re-design the school building to promote
energy efficiency. Students researched green sources of energy and examples
of local and overseas Biophilic Eco-buildings that were able to reduce
overall energy consumption. Putting their learning from the 4-hour Minecraft
workshop into action, students create a practical and sustainable building
design and subsequently build it in Minecraft to be presented to classmates.&nbsp;</p>
