<p>In line with our Healthy Meals in School Programme (HMSP), we would like to refresh parents with an infographic on some simple and easy-to-prepare snacks. These snacks can be prepared for consumption during break-time in the classrooms. Even better, you can engage your child's help when preparing these snacks for some healthy parent-child bonding time.</p>
