<p>As football is a team sport, our P3 to P6 students will not only learn playing techniques, they will also learn important values like sportsmanship, teamwork and self-discipline. We aim to&nbsp;train and equip our students with the techniques to play the game skilfully at their own comfortable pace. We emphasise more on the learning process and character development of each of our students so as to ensure that he graduates from our school a better person and a more skilful football player than he was when he first joined us.</p>
