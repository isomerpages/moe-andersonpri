<h4><strong>Boys' Brigade Day</strong></h4>
Every year on 12 January, the BB 22J Company from Anderson Primary School commemorated Boys’ Brigade(BB) Day in the school hall. The Boys felt proud donning their full uniform to form a contingent for the occasion.  Our Boys are given the opportunity to give the commands to the whole school to stand in attention. Our Lead Boy will present the the BB Message and update what the activities carried out through the year.
