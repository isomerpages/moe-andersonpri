<h4><strong>BB and GB Enrolment Ceremony</strong></h4>
<p>On 21 May 2022 (Saturday), the Boys' Brigade (BB) and Girls' Brigade (GB) had their enrolment at Presbyterian High School (PHS). It was a joyous occasion as the two Brigades could come together as the Covid-19 pandemic had disrupted the face-to-face (f2f) sessions for the past 2 years. Despite this, the students made the best out of the constraints faced. Their parents were also invited, and they found the ceremony significant and meaningful. Our BB Boys, Ashton Khoo and Cheong Jun Chun also shared in our recent enrolment ceremony, the varied and meaningful experiences they had over the past two years.</p>

<h4><strong>Community Service at Thye Hua Kwan Senior Activity Centre (THKSAC)</strong></h4>
<p>The P4 BB Boys visited Thye Hua Kwan Senior Activity Centre at Blk 645 Ang Mo Kio Ave 9 on 19 August 2022 (Friday) to carry out a community service project - BB Cares. There were about 45 elderly folks eagerly playing games like the Local Dish Bingo and Connect the Dot Challenge, with the help of the Boys who were by their side. The parting gifts from the Boys were the paper baskets the Boys had woven at home with their parents. It was a fun and meaningful experience for the Boys. We would like to extend our sincere appreciation to our school leaders, parents, volunteers and teachers for supporting us in our journey of growth. We look forward to scaling greater heights for the 22nd Junior Company.</p>

<h4><strong>Learning Journey at SEA Aquarium</strong></h4>
<p>The 22J Boys&rsquo; Brigade Boys were so excited about their very first learning journey since the CCA started in Anderson Primary in 2020. On 26 August 2022 (Friday), 22J visited the SEA Aquarium. The boys were taken on a guided tour and visited many beautiful marine animals. They learnt much about the life cycle, habitat, food chain and the impact of climate change on these marine animals. The amazing sea creatures they saw included dolphins, jellyfish, sharks, manta rays, and corals. The Boys ended their amazing day by touching the sea stars. The Boys had an enriching, meaningful and fun time learning together at the SEA Aquarium.Jellyfish Enclosure &ndash; The Boys learnt that jellyfish has no brain and skeleton.</p>

<h4><strong>Archery Workshop</strong></h4>
<p>An archery workshop was conducted on 27 August 2022 (Saturday) to familiarise the Volunteer Adult Leaders in both GB and BB. The trainers were Mr Anthony Tan from BBHQ and Mr Ong Chee Seng from 27th Singapore Company, PHS. It is our hope to bring the joy of archery to our BB Boys and GB Girls as well as to staff members of Anderson Primary School (APS). Mr Poh Chee Peng, a teacher in APS, joined the session and found it time well spent. He said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I attended the session. It&rsquo;s been a while since I learnt something new, and I enjoyed it more than I expected.&rdquo;</p>
