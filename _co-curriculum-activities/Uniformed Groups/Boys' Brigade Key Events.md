<h4><strong>Boys' Brigade Day</strong></h4>
Every year on 12 January, the BB 22J Company from Anderson Primary School commemorated Boys’ Brigade(BB) Day in the school hall. The Boys felt proud donning their full uniform to form a contingent for the occasion.  Our Boys are given the opportunity to give the commands to the whole school to stand in attention. Our Lead Boy will present the the BB Message and update what the activities carried out through the year.

<h4><strong>BB/GB Enrolment Ceremony</strong></h4>
It is the tradition that the Boys' Brigade (BB) and Girls' Brigade (GB) hold their annual enrolment ceremony at Presbyterian High School (PHS). It was a joyous occasion as the two Brigades come together and were smartly attired in full uniform as parents, teachers, volunteers and senior Boys and Girls witnessed the enrolment of the new BB Boys and GB Girls into the 22nd Company. At our enrolment ceremony, we celebrated our students’ achievements in their leadership journey as members of GB and BB.
