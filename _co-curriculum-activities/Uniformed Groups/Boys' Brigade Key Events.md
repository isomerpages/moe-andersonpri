<p>On 12 January 2022, the 22J Company commemorated Boys&rsquo; Brigade (BB) Day in the school hall by leading the school morning flag-raising ceremony. The Company Commander, Jake Ng (P5.4) and Squad Commander, Bryan Ang (P5.4) were the recipients of the Outstanding Boy Award in 2019. New leaders like G. Arjjun (P4.6) had the chance to share what he had learn and the impact BB had on him and his peers. The BB message was shared with the school via Zoom. It was a memorable day for the 22J Company.</p>

<h4><strong>BB and GB Enrolment Ceremony</strong></h4>
<p>On 21 May 2022 (Saturday), the Boys' Brigade (BB) and Girls' Brigade (GB) had their enrolment at Presbyterian High School (PHS). It was a joyous occasion as the two Brigades could come together as the Covid-19 pandemic had disrupted the face-to-face (f2f) sessions for the past 2 years. Despite this, the students made the best out of the constraints faced. Their parents were also invited, and they found the ceremony significant and meaningful. Our BB Boys, Ashton Khoo and Cheong Jun Chun also shared in our recent enrolment ceremony, the varied and meaningful experiences they had over the past two years.</p>

<h4><strong>BB Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>During our BB sessions, the Boys enjoyed a variety of engaging activities like team-building games, classroom lessons, and foot drills. They picked up important skills like map reading, using a compass, first aid and CCE values and skills. They had many opportunities to inculcate in them values such as resilience, teamwork and discipline.</p>
