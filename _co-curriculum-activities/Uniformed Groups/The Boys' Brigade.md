<h4><strong>The Boys’ Brigade 22J Singapore Company</strong></h4>
<p>The 22J Singapore Company was started on with 20 Boys and 2 officers and
2 teachers in 2019. Mr. Louis Seng is the Company Captain and Mr Li Wencong
is the Chaplin. The first batch of 20 Primary 3 Boys were enrolled in 2020.
Currently, Mr William Ho is the teacher-in-charge assisted by Ms Angela
Lee and Mdm Ng Lih Teng.</p>
<p>The 22J Boys’ Brigade Company offers a unique opportunity for Boys to
experience a programme designed for holistic development outside a classroom
environment – with a strong emphasis on discipline and character development.
It is also service oriented, grooming them to serve their families, the
school and the community.</p>
<p>The highlights of 22J Company in Anderson Primary School are character
building lessons, leadership adventures, parades, drills, games, badge
work, learning journeys and camps. We also actively participate in HQ events
such as BB Week, BB CARES, Adventure Quest and Character Quest.
