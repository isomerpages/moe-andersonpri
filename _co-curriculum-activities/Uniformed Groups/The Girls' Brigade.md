<p>The 22nd Girls’ Brigade (GB) Company started in Anderson Primary School
in 2020. The CCA aims to develop character and skills so that the girls
can achieve their fullest potential through positive character-based teachings
and activities. In addition, we aim to equip, empower and enable every
girl to be a leader.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Self-discipline is the cornerstone of the Girls’ Brigade. Through regular
drill sessions, we instill the value of self-discipline to develop leadership
traits in the girls who will lead their peers by example in school and
at home.</p>
<p>GB offers&nbsp;our girls a wholesome learning experience and an all-rounded
programme that includes formal and informal activities. GB provides abundant
opportunities for the girls to form supportive friendships and to guide
their juniors. It is a good platform to develop in them our school values,
SEL Competencies, and character building, as well as opportunities to hone
their leadership skills through fun-filled and meaningful activities. Other
positive traits of self-respect, grooming and teamwork are also inculcated
through the structure of a Uniformed Group (UG) and the award of badges.
The girls learn essential moral values to cultivate a heart to serve through
community service.</p>
<p>The highlights of the 22nd Girls’ Brigade Company will include values-anchored
lessons, reflections, parades, drills, games, badge work, learning journeys,
community service and camps. They will also take part in school events
and HQ events such as Brigade Knowledge, Fast Food &amp; Fuzz Experience
and GB Friendship Day.</p>
