<p>The 22nd Girls’ Brigade (GB) Company began at Anderson Primary School
in 2020. The goal of the 22P Coy is to help Girls grow and develop their
skills so they can reach their full potential through positive teachings
and activities. We also want to help each Girl become a leader.</p>
<p>Self-discipline is very important in the Girls’ Brigade. Through regular
drill sessions, we teach the value of self-discipline, which helps Girls
develop leadership skills. They learn to lead self and others by being
good examples at school and at home.</p>
<p>The GB offers a well-rounded experience with many activities, both formal
and informal. Girls have the chance to make supportive friendships and
help their younger peers. Our 22P Coy reinforces our school values, fosters
social-emotional skills, and helps build character. It also provides chances
to practise leadership through fun activities. Other important traits like
self-respect, grooming, and teamwork are learned through being part of
a Uniformed Group (UG) and earning badges. The Girls also learn moral values
by participating in community service such as the Girls' Brigade Friend
in Deed project.</p>
<p>The highlights of the 22P Coy include lessons based on values, reflections,
parades, practice sessions, games, badge work, outdoor learning experiences,
community service, and camps. The Girls will also join school events and
special HQ events like Brigade Knowledge, Fast Food &amp; Fuzz Experience,
and GB Friendship Day.</p>
