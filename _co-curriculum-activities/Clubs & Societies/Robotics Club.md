<p>In Robotics Club, we engage our students in the learning of the basics of building and programming miniature robots using the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our mission is to nurture our students&rsquo; interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) by providing opportunities for our students to discover the exciting world of programming and equipping them with skills for the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our students work collaboratively in teams to develop problem-solving skills, creative thinking and team spirit through innovative play. They also train intensively to take part in a variety of competitions, such as the National Robotics Competition (NRC).</p>
