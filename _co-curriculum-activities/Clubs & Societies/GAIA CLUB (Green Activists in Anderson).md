<p>Green Activists In Anderson (formerly known as Green Club) is an environmental
conscious group formed in 2003. It promotes awareness of green issues and
encourages students to take actions on environmental issues at school and
community levels. In nurturing young Green Activists, the club hopes they
will play an active role in caring for our environment, and teaching others
how to do their part in protecting Mother Earth.</p>
