<p>The Angklung Ensemble aims to create a fun environment where our members
can come together to develop their passion for the arts and qualities of
musicianship. Through our weekly practices, our members learn the importance
of discipline and teamwork. We seek to inculcate in our members the value
of unity and togetherness as they work with one another to perfect the
performances. In line with our school values, the Angklung Ensemble continues
to nurture passionate and confident players who would strive for excellence
at every performance. In 2018, the Angklung Ensemble achieved the Accomplishment
Award at the SYF 2018 Arts Presentation (Instrumental Ensemble).</p>
