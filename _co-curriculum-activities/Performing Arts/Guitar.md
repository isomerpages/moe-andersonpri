<p>Anderson Guitar Ensemble was set up in 2005 and is filled with enthusiastic learners and players under the tutelage of Mr Clarence Chan. Our ensemble seeks to develop students&rsquo; passion for guitar playing and enhance their appreciation for music.</p>
<p>To provide greater opportunities for students to showcase their talents and hone their guitar playing skills,&nbsp;students&nbsp;have taken part in many school and public events such as public performances at Thye Hwa Kwan Hospital, Woodlands Regional Library, SYF Music Exchange Performance and our annual prize presentation ceremony. In 2018, our Guitar Ensemble achieved the Distinction Award at the SYF 2018 Arts Presentation (Instrumental Ensemble).</p>
