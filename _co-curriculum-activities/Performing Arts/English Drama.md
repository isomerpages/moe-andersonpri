<p>The English Drama first started in 2000. Our aim is to provide students with opportunities to develop self-confidence, creativity and drama skills that are useful in building their disposition in public speaking. We work with established drama companies such as The Necessary Stage and Act 3 International and seek to put up performances both in school and at other public platforms.</p>
