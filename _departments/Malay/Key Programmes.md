<p><strong>Learning Journey to the Malay Heritage Centre</strong></p>
<p>In commemoration of SG Bicentennial, the Malay Language Department organised a learning journey to the Malay Heritage Centre on 27 Mar 2019 (Wed). This learning journey was also planned as one of the highlight programmes during our Mother Tongue Fortnight.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""><span class="">Through the learning journey, our students were able to better appreciate the contributions by the Malay community in the development of Singapore as a nation. By getting to know their identity and origins, we hope that students will develop a keener sense of belonging and love for Singapore.</span></p>
