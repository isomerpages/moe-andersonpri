<p><strong>Vision<br /></strong>Resilient and Reflective Problem Solvers who can connect Mathematics to everyday life situations.</p>
<p><strong>Mission<br /></strong>To provide authentic and rigorous Mathematics education with problem-solving opportunities that develop learners to discover, experience, reason and communicate Mathematics.</p>
<p><strong>Our Approach<br /></strong>The Mathematics Framework focuses on using Mathematics for problem solving.&nbsp;The development of problem-solving ability is dependent on five inter-related components, namely, conceptual understanding, skills proficiency, mathematical processes, and attitudes and metacognition.</p>

<p>In Anderson Primary School, we believe that every student is a Math Learner who possesses the learning dispositions and work habits of a Mathematician. Our students are to be able to see themselves as learners of Mathematics who persevere in making sense of a problem, a procedure, a concept and seek connections among ideas.</p>
