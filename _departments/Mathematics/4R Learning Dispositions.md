<p><strong>Every Andersonian A Mathematician, A Problem Solver<br /></strong><strong>- 4R Learning Dispositions of ANDPS Mathematicians</strong></p>
<p>We believe that every student is a valuable, unique individual who can learn and has the potential to succeed. While supporting our students in knowledge and skill learning, we also build an environment that invites and provokes the stretching of dispositional learning muscles of our young mathematicians, our problem-solvers.</p>
