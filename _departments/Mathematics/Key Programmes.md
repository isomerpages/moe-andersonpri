<p>Our Math programmes and learning experiences are uniquely planned and designed so as to develop in our students a deep understanding of mathematical concepts. These learning experiences include hands-on activities and the use of technological aids to help them relate abstract mathematical concepts with concrete experiences.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Model-Eliciting Activities in Mathematics<br /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Model-Eliciting Activities (MEAs) are designed to develop mathematical understanding and competencies through the application of knowledge and skills to solve authentic real-world problems. Students intepret and make reasonable assumptions and simplifications mathematically before evaluating real-world problems.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>The following two key principles guide the design of the MEA in Mathematics;</p>
<p>(i)&nbsp;Reality Principle: Problem posed is open-ended, meaningful and relevant to the students and based on real or slightly modified real data.</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;Model Construction Principle: Problem allows for the creation of a model involving two or more variables, establishing relationships between the variables and deriving the patterns governing these relationships.</p>
<p><strong>MEA in Primary 3<br /></strong>Primary 3&nbsp;students investigate the relationship between the length of a person's foot to his/her height. The collective data of each group of students are plotted in Excel and a best-fit line is used to predict the height of 'Bigfoot'. Through this experience, students appreciate the value of Mathematics in everyday life and gain motivation in applying Mathematics.</p>

<p><strong>MEA in Primary 5</strong><br />Primary 5 students construct a popcorn box as one of the activities in 'I am a Young Mathematician' card. They use the idea of optimisation, apply visualisation skill, spatial reasoning and geometric modelling skill to solve this mathematical optimisation problem.</p>
<p><strong>PERI Holistic (HA) Assessment<br /></strong>Holistic assessment refers to the process of using multiple sources to continually gather information on a child&rsquo;s development, to provide feedback to support and guide learning.&nbsp;Holistic Assessment aims to&nbsp;support student learning and development, to build their confidence and desire to learn, and to better prepare them for the future.</p>
<p>The assessments can take various forms such as bite-sized assessment, performance assessments, journals and problem solving tasks. These assessments will be carried out throughout the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learning Support Programme<br /></strong>LSM&nbsp;(Learning Support for Mathematics) is an early intervention programme aims at providing learning support to students who do not have foundational numeracy skills and knowledge to access the Primary 1 Mathematics curriculum. A screening process is carried at the beginning of Primary 1 to identify the students who need intervention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Anderson Primary School, P1 and P2 students who are in the programme will attend Mathematics lessons conducted by our LSM Teachers in small groups during curriculum hours so that greater attention can be devoted to each student.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)<br /></strong>Beyond P2, the support in the learning of Mathematics continues in the form of ICAN Programme. This programme aims to strengthen students&rsquo; conceptual understanding and procedural fluency.&nbsp;ICAN emphasises the importance of concrete learning to enable pupils to make better sense of&nbsp;
their learning. Students have lots of fun in their mathematics learning as they gain confidence and motivation in learning the subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lessons are conducted by ICAN Teachers in small groups during curriculum hours.&nbsp;</p>
