<p>Our Mathematics programmes and learning experiences are thoughtfully designed
to nurture a deep and lasting understanding of mathematical concepts in
our students. These experiences incorporate hands-on activities and the
purposeful use of educational technology, enabling students to connect
abstract ideas with real-world, concrete applications. Through this approach,
we aim to make Mathematics engaging, meaningful, and accessible to every
learner.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Topical and Heuristics Worksheets &amp; Holistic Assessment (PERI HA)<br></strong>To
support the development of mathematical understanding and problem-solving
skills, our school designs topical worksheets for all levels as part of
formative assessment and to reinforce key concepts taught during Mathematics
lessons. In addition, a structured set of heuristics worksheets is provided
to strengthen students’ analytical thinking and application of problem-solving
strategies.</p>
<p>As part of the PERI Holistic Assessment (HA) approach, we adopt a wide
range of assessment methods—including topical worksheets, performance tasks,
and experiential learning activities—carried out throughout the year. This
holistic approach enables teachers to gather meaningful information on
each student’s progress, provide targeted feedback, and nurture their confidence,
motivation, and enjoyment of learning.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Support Programme<br></strong>LSM&nbsp;(Learning Support
for Mathematics) is an early intervention programme aims at providing learning
support to students who do not have foundational numeracy skills and knowledge
to access the Primary 1 Mathematics curriculum. A screening process is
carried out at the beginning of Primary 1 to identify the students who
need intervention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Anderson Primary School, P1 to P4 students who are in the programme
will attend Mathematics lessons conducted by our LSM Teachers in small
groups during curriculum hours so that greater attention can be devoted
to each student.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Spatial Visualisation Skills Programme (P1)<br></strong>The Spatial
Visualisation Skills Programme aims to enhance our lower primary students’
visual and spatial awareness. The use of Tangram Puzzle not only keeps
our young minds engaged but also deepens their interest and understanding
in topics which require visual-spatial skills as they move up the levels.</p>

<p><strong>Fostering 21st Century Competencies <br></strong>Initiatives were
introduced to provide students with opportunities to develop key competencies
for the 21st century, particularly in Critical, Adaptive, and Inventive
Thinking (CAIT).</p>
<p><strong>Students Learning Space (SLS) as a platform for EdTech</strong>
<br>At our school, we leverage the Student Learning Space (SLS) as a key platform
to enhance our Mathematics lessons. Through SLS, our pupils engage with
interactive and tailored digital resources that complement classroom teaching,
allowing them to explore concepts at their own pace. This integration of
technology not only deepens their understanding of mathematical ideas but
also encourages independent learning and critical thinking. By leveraging
SLS, we aim to support every learner’s individual needs and foster essential
21st-century skills in a flexible and engaging way.</p>

<p><strong>Lower Primary Math Activities Corner&nbsp;</strong>
<br>To enhance the learning experience in Mathematics, our Lower Primary classrooms
have introduced a Math Activities Corner. This dedicated space offers a
range of hands-on, student-directed activities designed to reinforce important
mathematical concepts, develop visual-spatial skills and social skills,
promote problem-solving skills, and foster a love for the subject. Through
these engaging tasks, students also develop key 21st-century competencies,
particularly Critical, Adaptive, and Inventive Thinking (CAIT), in a supportive
and enjoyable environment.</p>

<p><strong>P3 Problem-Based Task</strong>
<br>A key initiative is the Primary 3 Problem-Based Task (PBT), designed using
the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach. In this task, students acted
as mathematicians, collaborating to solve open-ended problems related to
food sustainability and environmental stewardship. They designed an eco-garden
using multi-link cubes and explored strategies to increase carrot production
within constraints. The task encouraged creative reasoning, fostering multiple
solutions and an interest in mathematics while enhancing problem-solving
skills and understanding of real-world applications.</p>

<p><strong>Primary 4 Math Sustainability Trail<br></strong>The Primary 4
students participated in the Math Sustainability Trail. The trail aimed
at exploring the 3Rs—Recycle, Reduce, and Reuse—through mathematics. Students
measured a recycling bin to estimate capacity, explored how to reduce tiling
materials in the garden, and learnt about compost bins to reuse food waste.
These hands-on activities developed observation, visualization, logical
reasoning, and analysis skills. Working in groups, students reflected the
school’s LIGHT values, collaborating and innovating to solve real-life
problems. This initiative connected classroom learning with practical sustainability
efforts, demonstrating how mathematics applies beyond the classroom to
address real-world challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Excellence 2000 (E2K) Programme (P5 &amp; 6)</strong>
</p>
<p>The E2K Mathematics Programme aims to develop mathematical reasoning skills
and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach.</p>
<p>Students will have opportunities to collaborate with their peers and engage
in mathematical thinking through resources such as puzzles, games and mathematics
explorations which are specially designed for the programme. The rich learning
experiences offered by the programme serve to help students to develop
the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess, as well
as to gain important 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive
thinking and effective communication skills.</p>
