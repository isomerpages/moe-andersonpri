<p class="">Launched in 2017, Anderson's first Living Arts Gallery is an active learning space that encourages creative and collaborative play through the arts. Inspired by the Reggio Emilia approach, the Gallery is designed as an environment where pupils can explore their inner creativity, and connect with their senses to see, listen, touch, feel and wonder. Serving as both an exhibitive and interactive space, the Gallery also provides opportunities for pupils to view, experience and appreciate the various art forms.<br /><br /><strong>Principles of Reggio Emilia Approach adopted by the Living Arts Gallery<br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Children are competent in constructing their own learning. Being naturally curious about the environment they are in, children learn through experiences of touching, moving, listening, seeing and hearing.</li>
<li>Children are capable of exploratory play with other children and material things.</li>
<li>Children know how to communicate and enjoy having multiple ways and opportunities to express their ideas, values and understanding.</li>
<li>The environment is the third teacher. As an exciting place that generates a lot of information, children can learn and get knowledge through interacting with the environment.</li>
</ul>
