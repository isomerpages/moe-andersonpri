<p>Our whole-school arts education programme articulates a well-developed arts education policy aimed at nurturing our students in values of performance character and moral character essential for life and life-long learning. It is founded upon a three-prong approach: Ownership, Craftsmanship and Leadership. Our overall arts education is also very much aligned to our school&rsquo;s distinctive programme, ANDventure (Arts), and our Learning for Life Programme (Music &amp; Performing Arts).</p>
<p>Under Ownership in the Arts, all pupils learn with passion and are given opportunites in all art forms to encourage them in growing their interests in the Arts.</p>

<p><strong><em>Ownership in the Arts &ndash; Enjoy!</em></strong></p>
