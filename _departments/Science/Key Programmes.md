<p><strong>ICT-enriched packages &amp; blended learning</strong>
<br>Students learn Science using the inquiry approach via a variety of ICT
tools and learning packages. Through the use of IPads within the classrooms
and the Singapore Student Learning Space&nbsp;(SLS), we transform the learning
experiences of our students through the purposeful use of technology to
enable students to engage in different learning modes, including self-directed
and collaborative learning. The learning of Science is not confined to
the textbook and the classrooms, but is seamlessly integrated into the
students’ lives.</p>

<p><strong>Sparkle through Games</strong>
<br>In addition to reviewing concepts learnt during lessons, playing games
also teach important soft skills like teamwork, decision-making, and learning
to communicate and interact with one another. Learning through games not
only encourages thinking but also cultivates a joy and motivation in the
learning of Science.</p>

<p><strong>Outdoor Learning</strong>
<br>To nurture a sense of appreciation for nature and encourage Andersonians
to do their part for the environment, various science enrichment modules
have been designed to provide outdoor learning experiences and opportunities
for self-discovery through hands-on doing.</p>

<br><strong>Sustainability Education</strong>
<br>We want every Andersonians to become responsible and reflective citizens
and environment stewards of sustainability. Our sustainability programme
is infused into our primary school Science curriculum, to prepare our students
for a more sustainable future for Singapore. We hope our students will
embrace and champion the Singapore Green Plan 2030.</p>

<p><strong>STEM ALP - Eureka!</strong>
<br><strong><em>Eureka!</em></strong>&nbsp;comprises&nbsp;<strong>STEM modules</strong>&nbsp;delivered
through the curriculum, after school enrichment and CCA. These STEM modules
focus on experiential learning, self-discovery through doing, and cultivation
of thinking dispositions of a Mathematician, Scientist and Engineer. The
Engineering Design Process will be used to scaffold students’ thinking,
facilitate the processes of problem solving and provide the structure for
product design. We hope that these varied learning experiences will inspire
Andersonians, as Pioneers of the Future, to contribute towards STEM research,
innovation and enterprise and pursue STEM-related careers to serve the
good of society.</p>

<p><strong>E2K Science Programme</strong>
<br>This programme aims to foster independence in scientific inquiry and develop
science process skills, as well as nurture other important 21<sup>st</sup> century
competences such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive
thinking, and effective communication skills.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Young Scientist Badge Programme</strong>
<br>The Young Scientist Badge Programme aims to strengthen self-directed,
hands-on learning and serves as an extension to current learning experiences
in SLS. It is designed to cultivate interest in and encourage the exploration
of STEM among our students.</p>
