<p><strong><u>Learning through Games</u></strong><br>In addition to reviewing concepts learnt during lessons, playing games also teach important soft skills like teamwork, decision-making, and learning to communicate and interact with one another. Learning through games not only encourages thinking but also cultivates a joy and motivation in the learning of Science.</p>
<p></p>


<p><strong><u>Outdoor Learning</u></strong><br>To nurture a sense of appreciation for nature and encourage Andersonians to do their part for the environment, various science enrichment modules have been designed to provide outdoor learning experiences and opportunities for self-discovery through hands-on doing.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>(i)&nbsp;Friend or Foe Workshop</strong><br>Friend or Foe is a Biodiversity Learning Experience focused on drawing awareness and appreciation for the diverse range of bugs and insects that live in small green urban spaces around us. Conducted by&nbsp;trainers from an environmental social enterprise, Cultivate Central, students learnt about the special characteristics of different bugs and the different roles they play.</p>
<p>Primary 3 students had an outdoor classroom experience to explore the regenerative gardens in the school, to observe and identify the bugs and insects residing in these areas. Up close, our Young Entomologists had an opportunity to see the different stages in the life cycle of a rhinoceros beetle. Through this workshop, our students learnt what it means to have balance and diversity in the green spaces in school, at home and in our beautiful garden city.</p>

<p class=""><strong class=""><span class="">(ii)&nbsp;</span></strong><strong class=""><span class="" lang="EN-SG">Hydroponics&nbsp;&amp; Plant Parts Module</span></strong><br>This in-house programme aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for our Primary 3 students to appreciate and learn more about plant life, participate in the process of crop growing, develop teamwork, motivate respect and values for life in nature as well as encourage healthy eating habits.</span></p>
<p class="">During the growing process, students have the opportunity to observe different plant parts such as plant roots, without pulling the plant out of its environment. Students will transplant their seedlings into the hydroponics system and watch the development of their crop until it is ready to be harvested and consumed.</p>

<p class=""><strong class=""><span class="" lang="EN-SG">(iii) Back to Nature &ndash; Replant &amp; Grow</span></strong><span class="" lang="EN-SG"><br class="" /></span><span class="">Back to Nature &ndash; Replant and Grow aims to nurture budding Young Botanists with an appreciation and love for our nature&rsquo;s greenery. Primary 5 students participated in various activities such as micro-farming recycled bottle garden and terrarium-making.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""><span class="">In the micro-farming workshop, students discovered the various components of healthy, &lsquo;living&rsquo; soil. Students worked in groups and got their hands dirty to mix these components together to create their own organic soil. This organic soil was then transferred into their fabric planter beds to grow bak choy, spring onions and lettuce. In the recycled bottle garden lesson, each student had the opportunity to create their own bottle garden or terrarium using simple materials such as a plastic bottle, Fittonia, pebbles and peat moss.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="">Through these hands-on activities, students learned about the science behind composting, how a bottle garden can be self-sustaining and brought home organic crops to share with their families.</p>

<p><strong><u>Learning Journeys</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>(i) </strong><strong>Singapore Zoo</strong><br>Primary 3 students visit the Singapore Zoo to learn about the body coverings of different animal groups and its functions. In addition, students get to complete a Zoo trail that is designed by our teachers to encourage students to classify a variety of&nbsp;animals they see based on their similarities and differences using common observable characteristics. This trail also broadens students&rsquo; knowledge of examples of animals in the different animal groups they have learnt under the Diversity theme.&nbsp;</p>
<img style="width: 65%;" src="/images/2021%20SCI%20-%20pic%2014.png" />

<p><strong>(ii) </strong><strong>Singapore Science Centre</strong><br>Learning journeys to the Singapore Science Centre are organised for students to deepen and extend their learning. Primary 4 students attended the Heat and Temperature workshops where they worked in groups to apply concepts on heat and temperature to tackle the design challenge of using materials to reduce heat gain.

<p class=""><strong class=""><u class=""><span class="" lang="EN-SG">Science Experiential Day/Week</span></u></strong><br>Science Experiential Day/Week aims to raise awareness and empower Andersonians to be Environment Stewards of Sustainability. Under the theme of Sustainable Energy, upper primary students will learn more about green energy sources and concepts on energy efficiency while reflecting on how they can do their part to conserve energy.<br class="" /></span></strong></p>
<p class=""><strong class=""><span class="" lang="EN-SG">(i) Energy Conservation Week</span></strong><br>Aligned to the topic of Electricity and the Anderson vision of nurturing every Andersonian to be a responsible Environment Steward, the Energy Conservation Week aims to create hands-on opportunities for students to learn about real-world phenomena and issues in electricity use and conservation.</span></p>
<p class="">Primary 5 students took on the role of a Young Energy Saver Scientist to investigate the efficiency of light conversion from electrical energy from different bulb sources at the &lsquo;Bulb in a Box&rsquo; Interaction Activity Booth. At the &lsquo;Food for Thought&rsquo; Interaction Activity Booth, students had the opportunity to generate electricity using food and investigate which types of food generate a higher amount of electricity. Throughout the week, students also carried out the various activities under the &lsquo;I am a Young Energy Saver&rsquo; Badge Scheme to learn more about Energy Conservation.</p>
<p class=""><span class="" lang="EN-SG">Through the Science Activity Booths and the Young Energy Saver Activity Book, we hope to develop in Andersonians an appreciation for energy resources, for them to understand the rationale behind the need to conserve electrical energy and learn ways to do their part in the responsible use and conservation of electricity for sustainable living.</span></p>
