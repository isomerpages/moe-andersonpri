<p><strong>Approach</strong></p>
<p>The Science curriculum at Anderson Primary seeks to develop in students an inquiring mind where they question what they observe, obtain evidence to explain phenomena, be able to connect to a variety of contexts and communicate science concepts effectively. Students&rsquo; natural curiosity and passion for exploring science will be ignited and sustained through various hands-on multi-disciplinary learning experiences that are integrated across contexts and subjects. These would include practical work, outdoor learning, ICT-enriched packages, Young Scientist Badge Scheme and STEM &ndash; Eureka Applied Learning Programme. Sustainability Education will also be infused within the curriculum and integrated with other subject disciplines to inculcate in Andersonians the right values, ethics and attitudes to understand the challenges of climate change and its impact on Singapore.</p>
<p>At Anderson Primary, we believe that every Andersonian can become responsible and reflective citizens and Environment Stewards of Sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>Outdoor Learning Spaces</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Green spaces&rsquo; at the&nbsp;<em>Biodiversity Garden</em>,&nbsp;<em>Regenerative Garden</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>Hydroponics Stations</em>&nbsp;aim&nbsp;to inculcate a love for nature among Andersonians&nbsp;and make the learning of Science more authentic through various experiential activities. Accompanying resources have been designed to encourage outdoor hands-on learning about:</p>
<ul>
<li>urban farming and the issue of food security,</li>
<li>the science behind composting,</li>
<li>different types of plants: the creepers, the flowering and the non-flowering,</li>
<li>different parts of the plants, and how different plants have different plant parts for various purposes, </li>
<li>reproductive parts of a plant,</li>
<li>life cycle of the butterfly, </li>
<li>interactions among living things, and</li>
<li> how the flora and fauna are adapted for different purposes.</li>
</ul>
