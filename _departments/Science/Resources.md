<p><strong><u>Outdoor Learning Spaces</u></strong><br>‘Green spaces’ at the <i> <font color="black"> Biodiversity Garden, Regenerative Garden, Urban Farming Towers and the Hydroponics Stations </i>aim to inculcate a love for nature among Andersonians and make the learning of Science more authentic through various experiential activities. Accompanying resources have been designed to encourage outdoor hands-on learning about:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>urban farming and the issue of food security,</li>
<li>the science behind composting,</li>
<li>different types of plants: the creepers, the flowering and the non-flowering,</li>
<li>different parts of the plants, and how different plants have different plant parts for various purposes,  </li>
<li>reproductive parts of a plant,</li>
<li>life cycle of the butterfly,</li>
<li>interactions among living things, and</li>
<li>how the flora and fauna are adapted for different purposes.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> The ‘Brown space’ at the _Community Vermicomposting Station_ aims to raise awareness on how to recycle organic food waste into vermicast (an organic fertilizer) for the school gardens using worms. Through this closed-loop community food waste system, our Green Ambassadors are empowered to set up a composting hub in the school, while our Primary 1 and 2 students learnt about worm farming ecosystems through their PAL- Outdoor Education module.</p>

<p> Roving Exhibitions are also featured at Anderson Primary School at various times of the year as outreach progrmmes to promote Sustainbility Education and Environment Stewardship. These include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>‘Natural Heritage’ Exhibits from NParks and Singapore Botanic Gardens (SBG) for students to learn about and appreciate the rich biodiversity in the nature parks, the significance of SBG as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and our gardens’ efforts at environmental sustainability.</li>
<li>‘R.I.S.E to the Challenge’ Exhibit to engage Andersonians on the issue of Climate Change and the challenge of the rising sea levels. </li>
<li>‘Energy Heroes!’ Exhibit comprised five game exhibits for Andersonians to appreciate the importance of energy and what we can do to conserve energy.</li>
<li>‘The Inflatable Lung’ exhibition allowed Andersonians to take a step into one of the largest organs in our body that keeps us alive and breathing. Students also had an opportunity to participate in a challenge where they find out how “powerful” their lungs are.</li>
<li> ‘Marine Tank’ Interaction Booth where students learnt about ecosystems, habitats, adaptations and had the opportunity to ‘touch’ various marine organisms. </li>
