#### Outdoor Learning Spaces
#### 

'Green spaces' at the *Biodiversity Garden, Regenerative Garden, Urban Farming Towers* and the *Hydroponics Stations* aims to inculcate a love for nature among Andersonians and make the learning of Science more authentic through various experiential activities. Accompanying resources have been designed to encourage outdoor hands-on learning about:

* urban farming and the issue of food security,
* the science behind composting,
* different types of plants: the creepers, the flowering and the non-flowering,
* different parts of the plants, and how different plants have different plant parts for various purposes,
* reproductive parts of a plant,
* life cycle of the butterfly,
* interactions among living things, and
* how the flora and fauna are adapted for different purposes.
