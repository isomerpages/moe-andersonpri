#### Outdoor Learning Spaces

'Green spaces' at the *Biodiversity Garden, Regenerative Garden, Urban Farming Towers* and the *Hydroponics Stations* aims to inculcate a love for nature among Andersonians and make the learning of Science more authentic through various experiential activities. Accompanying resources have been designed to encourage outdoor hands-on learning about:

* urban farming and the issue of food security,
* the science behind composting,
* different types of plants: the creepers, the flowering and the non-flowering,
* different parts of the plants, and how different plants have different plant parts for various purposes,
* reproductive parts of a plant,
* life cycle of the butterfly,
* interactions among living things, and
* how the flora and fauna are adapted for different purposes.

The 'Brown space' at the *Community Vermicomposting Station* aims to raise awareness on how to recycle organic food waste into vermicast (an organic fertilizer) for the school gardens using worms. Through this closed-loop community food waste system, our Green Ambassadors are empowered to set up a composting hub in the school, while our Primary 1 and 2 students learnt about worm farming ecosystems through their PAL - Outdoor Education module.

*Roving Exhibitions* are also featured at Anderson Primary School at various times of the year as outreach programmes to promote Sustainability Education and Environment Stewardship. These include:

* 'Natural Heritage' Exhibits from NParks and Singapore Botanic Gardens (SBG) for students to learn about and appreciate the rich biodiversity in the nature parks, the significance of SBG as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and our gardens' efforts at environmental sustainability.
* 'R.I.S.E. to the Challenge' Exhibit to engage Andersonians on the issue of Climate Change and the challenge of the rising sea levels.
* 'Energy Heroes!' Exhibit comprised five games exhibits for Andersonians to appreciate the importance of energy and what we can do to conserve energy.
* 'The Inflatable Lung' exhibition allowed Andersonians to take a step into one of the largest organs in our body that keeps us alive and breathing. Students also had an opportunity to participate in a challenge where they find out how 'powerful' their lungs are.
* 'Marine Tank' Ineraction Booth where students learnt about ecosystems, habitats, adaptations and had the opportunity to 'touch' various marine organisms.
