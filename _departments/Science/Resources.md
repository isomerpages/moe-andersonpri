<p><strong><u>Outdoor Learning Spaces</u></strong><br>‘Green spaces’ at the <i> <font color="black"> Biodiversity Garden, Regenerative Garden, Urban Farming Towers and the Hydroponics Stations </i>aim to inculcate a love for nature among Andersonians and make the learning of Science more authentic through various experiential activities. Accompanying resources have been designed to encourage outdoor hands-on learning about:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>urban farming and the issue of food security,</li>
<li>the science behind composting,</li>
<li>different types of plants: the creepers, the flowering and the non-flowering,</li>
<li>different parts of the plants, and how different plants have different plant parts for various purposes,  </li>
<li>reproductive parts of a plant,</li>
<li>life cycle of the butterfly,</li>
<li>interactions among living things, and</li>
<li>how the flora and fauna are adapted for different purposes.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> The ‘Brown space’ at the _Community Vermicomposting Station_ aims to raise awareness on how to recycle organic food waste into vermicast (an organic fertilizer) for the school gardens using worms. Through this closed-loop community food waste system, our Green Ambassadors are empowered to set up a composting hub in the school, while our Primary 1 and 2 students learnt about worm farming ecosystems through their PAL- Outdoor Education module.</p>

<p><strong>(i)&nbsp;Friend or Foe Workshop</strong><br>Friend or Foe is a Biodiversity Learning Experience focused on drawing awareness and appreciation for the diverse range of bugs and insects that live in small green urban spaces around us. Conducted by&nbsp;trainers from an environmental social enterprise, Cultivate Central, students learnt about the special characteristics of different bugs and the different roles they play.</p>
