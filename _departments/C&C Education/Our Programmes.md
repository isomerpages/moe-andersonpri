<p><strong>Learners with Passion, Leaders with Heart, Citizens of Character.</strong></p>
<p>Every Andersonian can learn for life and even excel in life. They can achieve this when they are anchored in the core values of&nbsp;<strong>Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony (R3ICH)</strong>, and are equipped with the right skills and competencies to become citizens of good character. With a strong sense of responsibility and a heart to lead and serve,</p>
<p><em>Andersonians will &hellip;<br /></em><strong>S</strong>hape the future of our nation as concerned and active citizens of character<br /><strong>H</strong>asten to empathise with others through understanding, acceptance and respect<br /><strong>I</strong>nitiate responsibility to family and community<br /><strong>N</strong>avigate complexities and challenges with resilience<br /><strong>E</strong>xcel in moral and performance character</p>
<p>At Anderson, a suite of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) experiences prepares students on a journey to become citizens of good character, both online and offline, as they learn to&nbsp;<strong><em>Step In, Step Back and Step Up</em></strong>:</p>
<p><strong><u>Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)</u></strong></p>
<p>Led by all Form Teachers, FTGP is conducted weekly in the form of interaction activities as well as lessons to facilitate students&rsquo; learning and application of social emotional (SE) competencies in the domains of self-awareness, social awareness, self-management, relationship management and responsible decision making.</p>
<p><strong><u>Class-based CCE Lessons</u></strong></p>
<p>The suite of CCE programmes and lessons in Anderson are motivated by our desire to nurture all Andersonians to be citizens of good character with a strong sense of responsibility who will contribute to the success of Singapore and the well-being of fellow Singaporeans. From the series of CCE lesson packages targeted at student development (see below), Andersonians develop an interconnected understanding of facts to make sense of the different perspectives around them.</p>

<p><strong><u>National Education (NE) Programmes and Social Studies</u></strong></p>
<p>The objective of NE is to develop national cohesion, the instinct for survival and confidence in the future,</p>
<ul>
<li>by fostering a sense of identity, pride and self-respect in our students as Singaporeans;</li>
<li>by knowing the Singapore story -- how Singapore succeeded against the odds to become a nation;</li>
<li>by understanding Singapore&rsquo;s unique challenges, constraints and vulnerabilities, which make us different from other countries;</li>
<li>and by instilling the core values of our way of life, and the will to prevail, that ensures our continued success and well-being.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Anderson, we commemorate four core NE events which have been identified as defining moments in Singapore&rsquo;s history every year. The aim is to entrench these events and the images they evoke in the consciousness of each successive generation.</p>

<p><strong><u>Values-in-Action (ViA): Anderson Primary Gives Back</u></strong></p>
<p>&lsquo;Anderson Primary Gives Back&rsquo; is part of our school&rsquo;s Values-In-Action programme that provides students with opportunities, from primary one to six, to learn what it means to contribute meaningfully to the community. As students prepare and actively contribute towards their ViA activities, we hope they will spend time reflecting how they have impacted the community and the lessons they have learnt as they play their part towards a caring and inclusive Singapore.</p>
<p>Some key focuses of our ViA activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Project BUDDY CLEAN</em>: My Home, My School (Primary 1)</li>
<li><em>Project JOY</em>:&nbsp;<strong>J</strong>oy -&nbsp;<strong>O</strong>urs to&nbsp;<strong>Y</strong>ours (Primary 2)</li>
