<p><strong>Character &amp; Citizenship Education @ Anderson</strong></p>
<p>We are Learners with Passion, Leaders with Heart, Citizens of Character. In Anderson, we believe that every Andersonian can learn for life and even excel in life. To this end, we are committed to providing different opportunities to support our students' holistic development through a total curriculum, which encompasses both curricular and co-curricular learning experiences in the following domains: Moral, Cognitive, Physical, Social and Aesthetics.</p>
<p>Our collective aspirations for our Andersonians, spelled out in our Vision and Motto, clearly articulate our constant motivation as a school to anchor students in good values, and to equip them with 21st century competencies and social emotional competencies to become Responsible, Resilient, Committed and Caring citizens of good character who have a strong sense of responsibility and who will contribute to the success of Singapore and the well-being of fellow Singaporeans.</p>
<p>Anchored upon a firm foundation of our school values (PQRS) and guided by the positive school culture of L.I.G.H.T, the CCE efforts in Anderson Primary School are premised on the belief of building character from the &lsquo;Head&rsquo; and &lsquo;Heart&rsquo; right down to the &lsquo;Hands&rsquo;. The exciting suite of CCE programmes and lessons in Anderson engage and encourage students to develop sound values and future readiness, essential mind-sets and skill sets to thrive in every stage of life.</p>
<p>Through a varied approach with programmes catered for all and for the different student segments, Andersonians are surrounded with opportunities and enriching CCE experiences to enable them to develop a holistic appreciation of diversity, a heightened sense of inclusivity, a courageous spirit to experiment and a voice to advocate for a worthy cause. They will become future-ready to embrace learning, leading and living with an abundance mind-set, and to make a positive difference to one and all.</p>
