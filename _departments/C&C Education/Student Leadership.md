<p style="text-align: center;">“A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way and shows the way.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">~ John C. Maxwell</p>

<p>This quote by John C. Maxwell reminds us of our mission to nurture outstanding student leaders who put others before self, who lead others out of a sincere heart, and who advocate the will to act for the school and community. It is our belief that a leader must lead self and others with a strong moral compass. They are to lead out of a light that shines the path for others.</p>
<p>Our vision for Student Leadership is to develop every Andersonian to be a confident Leader with Heart, who exemplify the school motto of courage and sincerity, and take initiative in making a positive difference in the school and community. Guided by our school values, PQRS, and the desired school culture of LIGHT, the school aspires to equip all students with values and competencies necessary to be authentic leaders who embrace a constancy of purpose in discovering and leading oneself, inspiring others and subsequently stewarding positive change in our community.</p>

<p><strong>Anderson Student Leaders Council (SLC)</strong><br>
The Student Leaders Council (SLC) is set up to bring cohesiveness and coherence to the overall student leadership development in ANDPS. For students who demonstrate the potential to take up formal student leadership positions and are keen to further develop their leadership competencies, they can be part of any of the following five formal leadership boards:</p>
<ul>
<li>School Prefectorial Board (SPB)</li>
<li>Character &amp; Citizenship Education Ambassadors (CCEA)</li>
<li>CCA Leaders (CCAL)</li>
<li>Cyber Wellness Ambassadors (CWA)</li>
<li>Green Ambassadors (GA)</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides the formal leadership boards, students also have the opportunity to develop their leadership competencies and dispositions through our uniformed groups, Boys’ Brigade (BB) and Girls’ Brigade (GB), or as members of the Class Committee (eg. class monitors, peer support leaders, green monitors and IT monitors).</p>

<p>Although each board has its own specific areas of functions and specialisation, they embrace a shared vision and common purpose and that is to serve ANDPS and the wider community beyond the school.</p>

<p>Aligned to the school vision of Leaders With Heart, the&nbsp;<strong>ANDerson Leadership Programme (ANDLP)</strong>&nbsp;develops student leaders using a 5-prong approach:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Holistic development of self</li>
<li>Stewarding change with design thinking</li>
<li>Recognition and affirmation</li>
<li>Mentoring</li>
<li>Reflection</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Dialogue with Mr Kevin Cheok, Singapore Ambassador to the Kingdom of Thailand&nbsp;<br></em></strong><strong><em>(Student Leaders OLJ 2019)</em></strong></p>

<p>‘Broadcasting’ live via Zoom for the first time on 17 February 2021 as part of the school’s weekly assembly programme, our Green Ambassadors stepped up to the mic and shared about the exciting activities that would be happening in the month of March – PUB’s Water Wednesdays, to encourage Andersonians to practise good habits to conserve water. This marks the birth of<strong>&nbsp;Anderson Airwaves</strong>, a news channel by student leaders for students.</p>
<p>Introduced in 2021 to foster a sense of community by promoting a vibrant learning environment for student voice and advocacy, the Anderson Airwaves provides opportunities for students to champion real-world issues in the form of their very own ‘news’ shows. Whether it is advocating kindness, peer support, environment stewardship, or simply presenting about other cultures from the world beyond Singapore, Anderson Airwaves puts the ownership of learning and sharing into the hands of Andersonians, nurturing them to be concerned, connected and confident citizens who care for something bigger than themselves.</p>
<p>“Before Anderson Airwaves, we’d just attend the weekly assembly, and hear about information that we felt like we already knew,” quotes a P6 student, “but when I hear about these things from my peers, over a live broadcast, I feel like I can do something too.”</p>
<p>For our Student Leaders, it is a small step towards stewarding positive change as Leaders with Heart. For the rest of the Anderson community, it is a big step towards shaping our identity as Citizens of Character.</p>
