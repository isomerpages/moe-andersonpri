<div><strong>ALIVE Programme</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>ALIVE which stands for Andersonians Living Actively through Values-based Experiences is the school&rsquo;s distinctive Learning for Life&nbsp;Programme. &nbsp;</div>

<div>The 4 main objectives of ALIVE are to provide authentic learning&nbsp;opportunities that cater to the mass student population, as well as&nbsp;additional exposure for segmented students with greater interest,&nbsp;aptitude and talent in sports.</div>

<div><strong>Sports Carnival</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The school organizes the annual sports day with a carnival-like spin to&nbsp;promote maximum participation in our students to promote healthy&nbsp;lifestyle through fun-filled healthy activities specially designed by our PE&nbsp;Department. It is also a good platform for students to practise the school&nbsp;values of Passion for Learning, Quest for Excellence, Respect for All and&nbsp;Service to the Community as they collaborate and compete with one&nbsp;another according to their House Colours: Ruby (Red), Sapphire (Blue),&nbsp;Emerald (Green) and Topaz (Yellow). Through participating in team&nbsp;games with their House-mates, the Sports Carnival provides the&nbsp;opportunity for our students to learn to work with others in achieving a&nbsp;common goal.</div>

<div><strong>Lower Primary Sports Carnival</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Lower Primary students will have their own Lower Primary Sports&nbsp;Carnival every year as part of our National Day Celebration. Again, the&nbsp;event ensures maximum participation in our students to promote healthy&nbsp;lifestyle through fun-filled healthy activities specially designed by our PE&nbsp;Department. On this day, the P1 and P2 students compete in a series of&nbsp;inter-class relay events that allow them to demonstrate the physical skills&nbsp;learnt during PE Lessons. The active interactions among students during&nbsp;the games also help to create invaluable authentic teachable moments to&nbsp;guide our students in character development and the inculcation of&nbsp;values.</div>

<div><strong>P5 Camp</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The P5 Camp is an integral part of the school PE curriculum. This 3-day-2-night residential camp provides authentic learning opportunities for&nbsp;students to be engaged in a wide range of outdoor sporting. It also serves&nbsp;to promote camping as a healthy outdoor activity through well-crafted&nbsp;and meaningful activities. By stepping out of their comfort zone, the camp&nbsp;allows students to build their personal resilience and collaboration skills&nbsp;to work in teams that would further develop their personal and&nbsp;interpersonal competencies.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>P3 Healthier Body and Mind Programme</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To provide a holistic education, this programme provides the opportunity&nbsp;for our P3 students to interact and train with professional sports players&nbsp;such as basketball, volleyball and footfall players. Through the first-hand&nbsp;interaction with these professional sportsmen, our young charges learn&nbsp;essential fundamental movement skills, as well as the desired values such&nbsp;as resilience, diligence, respect and integrity required in the sports arena.&nbsp;These skills and values are essential building blocks for them to lead a&nbsp;healthier lifestyle that would benefit their body and mind.</div>
