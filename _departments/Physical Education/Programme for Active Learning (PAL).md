<p>As part of the Primary Education Review and Implementation (PERI) recommendations, Programme for Active Learning (PAL) was conceptualised to address the need for greater emphasis on non-academic programmes for all Primary 1 and Primary 2 pupils. The following are the objectives of PAL:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide pupils with broad exposure and experiences through fun and varied activities in the following areas:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Sports and Games</li>
<li>Performing Arts (Music, Music and Movement)</li>
<li>Visual Arts</li>
<li>Drama</li>
<li>Outdoor Education</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Facilitate holistic development of pupils in the five domains, that are moral, cognitive, physical, social and aesthetics.</li>
<li>Provide varied avenues for pupils to develop social and emotional competencies. The modular approach to PAL provides pupils with a variety of learning experiences, allowing them to acquire a range of skills such as psycho-motor skills, problem-solving skills and social interaction skills. They will also develop confidence, cooperation and curiosity for learning as they go through the authentic learning experiences.</li>
</ol>
<p>Collectively, PAL modules will enhance the total experience of pupils in primary schools in the five domains of learning for a holistic education.</p>
