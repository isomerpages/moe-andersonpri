<p>At Anderson Primary School, Character comes first. While academic achievement
opens doors for our students’ future pathways, it is a strong, grounded
and morally upright character that enables Andersonians to flourish, contribute
meaningfully, and lead fulfilling lives.</p>
<p>Our Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum is designed
to nurture students in four key domains:</p>
<p><strong>1. Good Character</strong>
<br>Students develop a sound moral compass, discern right from wrong, think
critically and ethically, make responsible choices, show care and empathy
for others, and strive for excellence in all they do.</p>
<p><strong>2. Resilience &amp; Social-Emotional Well-Being</strong>
<br>They learn to understand themselves, build healthy relationships, stay
resilient in challenges, find meaning in their experiences, and cultivate
gratitude and appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>3. Future Readiness</strong>
<br>Students are guided to develop purpose, adaptability, and a mindset of
lifelong learning—essential qualities to navigate education and career
pathways confidently and meet future challenges.</p>
<p><strong>4. Active Citizenship</strong>
<br>They develop a strong sense of national identity and belonging, gain awareness
of Singapore’s realities and challenges, and are empowered with the will
to contribute to the well-being of others and to the nation’s future.</p>
<h4>Form Teacher Guidance Period (CCE FTGP)</h4>
<p>Cornerstone of our CCE curium, the Form Teacher Guidance Period provides
meaningful opportunities for teachers to connect with students through
structured activities, reflections, and discussions that strengthen Teacher–Student
Relationships (TSR) and build supportive peer relationships.</p>
<p>FTGP lessons cover six key CCE content areas:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Cyber Wellness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Education &amp; Career Guidance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mental Health</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sexuality Education</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these thematic lessons, students build values, social emotional
skills, and essential real world knowledge. They learn to navigate cyberspace
safely, understand mental well being, appreciate family relationships,
explore education and career pathways, and value Singapore’s racial and
religious diversity.</p>
<h4>Social Studies</h4>
<p>Social Studies and CCE/FTGP work together to nurture informed, empathetic,
and responsible citizens. Social Studies ignites students’ curiosity about
real world issues and, through inquiry and authentic learning, builds knowledge,
critical thinking, and an appreciation of diverse perspectives—deepening
their understanding of Singapore and its connections to the world.</p>
