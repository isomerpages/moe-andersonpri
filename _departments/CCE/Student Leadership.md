<p>At Anderson Primary School, we believe every child can lead, and leadership
is nurtured not only through formal roles but through everyday actions
grounded in character, competence, and consistency. Guided by Treffinger’s
Levels of Service (LoS) model, our tiered Leadership Development Framework
provides all Andersonians with progressive, meaningful opportunities to
discover their strengths, develop key leadership competencies, and apply
them authentically across school experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 1: Discover – Leadership for All (Class Committee)</strong>
<br>At this foundational level, all students take on <strong>Class Committee roles</strong> that
help them build confidence, practise teamwork, strengthen communication
skills, and develop a strong sense of ownership over their shared learning
environment.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 2: Develop – Leadership for Many (Student Leaders Council)</strong>
<br>Students who show interest, readiness, or emerging leadership qualities
are given opportunities in the Student Leaders Council to further develop
their leadership competencies.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 3: Apply and Lead – Leadership for a Few (Student Leaders Exco)</strong>
<br>At the highest tier, students with strong leadership aptitude, commitment,
and character serve in the Student Leaders Exco, where they take on advanced
responsibilities such as planning school-wide programmes, mentoring junior
leaders, championing student voice, and modelling exemplary conduct.&nbsp;</p>
