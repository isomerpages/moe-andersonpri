<p><strong>Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading (STELLAR) Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The STELLAR programme is designed to cater to a diverse range of EL learners
to build their confidence and enhance their oral language and literacy
development. Students are provided with opportunities to express&nbsp;themselves
in an environment where language learning can be enjoyable and purposeful.
By reading engaging stories in class, students get to speak extensively,
as well as discuss and share their views with the teacher and their peers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>ANDread - Addicted and Devoted to Reading</strong>
</p>
<p>Our reading programme is designed to foster a love for reading and build
good reading habits in every student.</p>
<p>In lower primary, students start with graded readers to strengthen basic
comprehension. At Primary 3 and 4, they explore childrenâ€™s literature to
develop critical thinking skills. By upper primary, students read news
articles to deepen their awareness of current events and real-world issues.</p>
<p>To enrich the experience, reading is paired with speaking activities,
where students share their favourite books and articles with classmates.</p>
<p>Through this progressive approach, we aim to grow confident readers, thoughtful
thinkers and effective communicators.</p>

<p><strong>ANDventure<br></strong>ANDventure is a signature programme for
our Primary Five Andersonians. Over the course of 10 weeks, students are
introduced to dramatisation techniques and work collaboratively to develop
a script based on real-world issues. Through this process, they take on
various roles and responsibilities, from acting to stage management. The
drama programme culminates in a vibrant showcase and celebration, where
students proudly present their performance to an audience of peers and
teachers. This meaningful experience nurtures creativity, teamwork, confidence
and a deeper awareness of issues in the world around them.</p>

<p><strong>Competitions and Enrichment<br></strong>Anderson enjoy a range
of competitions and enrichment programmes, including the Wits and Words
Debate, Reading Circles, Creative Writing Programme, NewsMaker Awards,
Vactors Reading Stars and Plain English Speaking Awards. These platforms
help students develop their speaking, writing, and critical thinking skills
while boosting their confidence. Inter- and intra-class competitions across
various areas of language learning are regularly organised to motivate
students to sharpen their language skills. Through these enriching experiences,
students discover new talents, challenge themselves, and unlock their full
potential.</p>
