<p><strong>EXTENSIVE READING PROGRAMME</strong></p>
<p><strong>ANDRead &ndash; Addicted and Devoted to Reading (P1 to P6)<br /></strong>To promote the love for reading and cultivate good reading habits among Andersonians through the innovative use of technology and incentive reward badges</p>
<p><strong>Graded Readers (P1)<br /></strong>Using curated books based on vocabulary, complexity of grammar structures and number of words, the graded readers cater to all levels from beginners through to advanced, giving each child the opportunity to develop essential skills at one&rsquo;s own pace.</p>
<p><strong>I Love Literature (P2 to P4)<br /></strong>Age-appropriate literature texts are selected to bring about enjoyment and engagement as Andersonians learn about literary elements, deepen comprehension skills, build on vocabulary, grammar and character values through a variety of exciting, cross-curricular and life skills activities.</p>
<p><strong>Little Red Dot (P5 to P6)<br /></strong>Upper Primary students are exposed to current affairs, both local and international, to help them understand the world around them.</p>
<p><strong>EL WEEK<br /></strong>The annual EL Week aims to promote the learning of the English Language in a fun and interactive way through various interesting activities planned for the week. Through these activities, Andersonians have ample opportunities to hone their 21st century competencies such as communication and collaborative skills.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR'S TALKS<br /></strong>When it comes to writing, every author has a different and unique take on his or her sources of inspiration and what makes for good writing. Authors are invited to share their writing experiences to help Andersonians learn more about the craft and techniques of creative writing.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT WORK (P1 to P6)<br /></strong>Project work is a platform where students have the opportunity to cooperate and collaborate with their peers. The tasks designed for each project require them to apply their knowledge to generate, develop and evaluate ideas. Each task is developed as an extension of a selected STELLAR unit.</p>
<p><strong>COMPETITIONS<br /></strong>The department identifies opportunities for Andersonians to participate in selected competitions such as Wits and Words: Inter-school Debate Competition and YMCA Plain English Speaking Awards to further enrich their learning experiences and develop their language competencies.</p>
