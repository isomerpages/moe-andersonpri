<p>The Angklung Ensemble aims to create a fun environment where our members can come together to develop their passion for the arts and qualities of musicianship. Through our weekly practices, our members learn the importance of discipline and teamwork. We seek to inculcate in our members the value of unity and togetherness as they work with one another to perfect the performances. In line with our school values, the Angklung Ensemble continues to nurture passionate and confident players who would strive for excellence at every performance. In 2018, the Angklung Ensemble achieved the Accomplishment Award at the SYF 2018 Arts Presentation (Instrumental Ensemble).</p>
