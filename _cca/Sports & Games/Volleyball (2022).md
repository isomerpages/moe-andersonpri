<p>Our volleyball teams consist of P3 to P6 students. Our students are trained by our professional and well-accredited coaches to equip them to play at a competitive level to take part in various volleyball competitions such as the North Zone Inter-Primary Schools Volleyball Championship and National Volleyball Championship. Our coaches focus on teaching various aspects of volleyball skills so that the students are proficient in a wide repertoire of offensive and defensive skills. As a result of this methodical approach, our teams have done well over the years.</p>
