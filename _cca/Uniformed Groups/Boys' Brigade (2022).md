<p>The 22J Boys&rsquo; Brigade (BB) Company started in Anderson Primary School in 2020. It offers a unique opportunity for boys to experience a programme designed for holistic development outside a classroom environment &ndash; with a strong emphasis on discipline and character development. It is also service oriented, grooming them to serve their families, our school and the community.</p>
</div>
<p>These are the 5 reasons why BB is the CCA of choice for boys:</p>
<ol>
<li>Leadership &ndash; We believe that every BB Boy is a leader and he will be given opportunities to lead according to his strengths.</li>
<li>Character &ndash; This is the core of our programme as we nurture boys to have strong values such as resilience to overcome challenges as well as the desire to excel in all tasks.</li>
<li>Mentoring &ndash; We are committed to developing boys to achieve their fullest potential through intentional mentoring.</li>
<li>Service Learning &ndash; We create opportunities for boys to serve their community and to show compassion to the people around them.</li>
<li>Family Engagement &ndash; We engage parents in meaningful ways to support the development of our BB boys.</li>
</ol>
<p>The highlights of Anderson Primary School&rsquo;s 22J Company are character-building lessons, leadership roles, parades, drills, games, badge work, learning journeys and camps. We also actively participate in HQ events such as BB Week, BB CARES, Character Quest and BB Share-A-Gift.&nbsp;</p>
