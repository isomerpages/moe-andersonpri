We believe when your child joins Anderson Primary School, your family also becomes a part of Anderson Family. Parents are important partners in enriching your child's learning as you know your child best. Every year, we provide opportunities for parents to participate in our school events and parent workshops.

To facilitate and co-ordinate these partnership with parents, we have a parent support group known as&nbsp;**PSG@ANDPS**&nbsp;in our school.&nbsp;**PSG@ANDPS**&nbsp;is made up of dedicated parents who aims to foster a close partnership amongst parents in our school so that we are able to Care and Share our collective efforts for our children in Anderson. Since&nbsp;**PSG@ANDPS**&nbsp;has started, we are delighted to have very supportive parents as a part of our Andersonian family. PSG Team. Meetings are held on a termly basis to co-ordinate events in the school.

We warmly invite all parents to be a member of the Parent Support Group to support the school in its programmes as well as to network with other like-minded parents!
