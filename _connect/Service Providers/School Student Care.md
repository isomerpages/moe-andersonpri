<h4><strong>Student Care Centre at Anderson Primary School</strong></h4>
<p>Anderson Primary School&rsquo;s school-based Student Care Centre (SCC) was set up in January 2018 with the aim of providing an after-school environment which is safe, structured and conducive for rest and learning after school hours. Managed by Commit Learning Schoolhouse, our school-based SCC plans programmes which are student-centric, age-appropriate and provide opportunities for Andersonians to develop social and emotional competencies. With a focus on inculcating positive values, the SCC teachers strive to engage the students with interesting activities and programmes.</p>
<p>If you are keen to enrol your child in the SCC, please complete the 'Indication of Interest in SCC Form'. You may access the form by clicking the link or scanning the QR code below. The school will contact you if there is an available vacancy for your child.</p>

<h4><strong>Anderson Primary School-Based SCC Enrolment Policy (w.e.f. 2020)</strong></h4>
<p>To ensure that our school-based SCC vacancies are able to cater to students with higher needs, we conduct a review of our SCC student enrolment once every 2 years. Parents of existing SCC students will be notified to submit their interest for a place in the SCC.</p>
<p>If we are unable to enroll your child/ward in our school-based SCC, you may want to consider an alternative community-based SCC near your home. You can search for other MSF-registered SCC by visiting the MSF website:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/dfcs/studentcare/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.msf.gov.sg/dfcs/studentcare/default.aspx</a>. You can enter your home postal code and set filters (such as &lsquo;less than 2 KM &rsquo; or &lsquo;less than 1 KM &rsquo; etc.) to search for a suitable community-based SCC near your home.</p>
