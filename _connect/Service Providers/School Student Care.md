<h4><strong>Student Care Centre at Anderson Primary School</strong></h4>
<p>Anderson Primary School’s school-based Student Care Centre (SCC) was set
up in January 2018 with the aim of providing an after-school environment
which is safe, structured and conducive for rest and learning after school
hours. Managed by Commit Learning Schoolhouse, our school-based SCC plans
programmes which are student-centric, age-appropriate and provide opportunities
for Andersonians to develop social and emotional competencies. With a focus
on inculcating positive values, the SCC teachers strive to engage the students
with interesting activities and programmes.</p>
<p>If you are keen to enrol your child in the SCC, please complete the 'Indication
of Interest in SCC Form'. You may access the form by clicking the link
or scanning the QR code below. The school will contact you if there is
an available vacancy for your child.</p>

<h4><strong>Anderson Primary School-Based SCC Enrolment Policy (w.e.f. 2020)</strong></h4>
<p>To ensure that our school-based SCC vacancies are able to cater to students
with higher needs, we conduct a review of our SCC student enrolment once
every 2 years. Parents of existing SCC students will be notified to submit
their interest for a place in the SCC.</p>
<p>If we are unable to enroll your child/ward in our school-based SCC, you
may want to consider an alternative community-based SCC near your home.
You can search for other MSF-registered SCC by visiting the MSF website:&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/dfcs/studentcare/default.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.msf.gov.sg/dfcs/studentcare/default.aspx</a>. You can enter
your home postal code and set filters (such as ‘less than 2 KM ’ or ‘less
than 1 KM ’ etc.) to search for a suitable community-based SCC near your
home.</p>
