<p>We encourage communication between parents and teachers; however, teachers
are not required to share personal phone numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responses may be delayed if teachers are in lessons, meetings, or otherwise
occupied. Please contact teachers during school hours (weekdays, 7am –
5pm).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For emergencies, parents should contact the General Office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For class- or lesson-related matters, please approach the relevant teacher
first. For further clarification, parents may contact the respective Year
Heads through their emails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Face-to-face meetings with teachers must be scheduled after 2pm; walk-ins
are not permitted as teachers may be teaching.</p>

<p>For discipline matters, the school adheres to Civil Service investigation
standards of 3, 7, and 21 working days.</p>

<li>
<p>Our staff are committed to working in partnership with parents with sincerity,
integrity, and professionalism. By demonstrating mutual respect and courtesy,
we model positive behaviour for our children. The school will disengage
from any communication that is rude, disrespectful, or abusive towards
staff. MOE values our staff and will take firm action to protect them against
unreasonable behaviour, harassment, or abuse.</p>
