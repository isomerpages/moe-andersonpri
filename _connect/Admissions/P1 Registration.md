<h4><strong>Phase 2B Parent Volunteer Scheme</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Parent Volunteer (PV) Scheme is open to parents of children who are
Singapore Citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents due for the P1 Registration
Exercise. The school selects PV applicants who are generally able to contribute
in areas which are aligned to the schoolâ€™s direction, programmes and desired
outcomes for both staff and students.
<br>
<br>Parents are to note that this scheme provides eligibility for priority
registration in the school under Phase 2B of the P1 Registration Exercise,
however it <u>does not guarantee</u> your child a place in the school for
the P1 admission.
